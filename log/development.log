Delaney"], ["date", "Jan 20, 2017"], ["review_text", "\n  \"Yes, daddy. Yes.\"\nNo. Please no. I feel like somebody noted the success of books like Gone Girl and the success of Fifty Shades of Grey and thought: wouldn't it be great if we had a book that combined the two? No, actually. No, it wouldn't.The Girl Before failed on so many levels, and I say that as a reluctant fan of these \"domestic thrillers\". I've enjoyed everything from The Girl on the Train to last year's ridiculous but fast-paced Behind Closed Doors. I expected I'd like this one too, but all I got was a weird relationship with \"rules\", another guy called Edward, and transparent twists.The book alternates between the perspectives of Emma (Before) and Jane (After) as they move into the techno-minimalist apartment at One Folgate Street. Though beautiful, there is almost no furniture, absolutely everything is digital, and most bizarre of all - the landlord and famous architect, Edward Monkford, requires that his tenants follow some very strict rules. Both women soon find themselves caught up in a love affair with Edward, but when Jane discovers that Emma died in the apartment, she can't help investigating further.Jane's digging uncovers some disturbing facts about Emma - she expressed concern over Edward's controlling ways to her psychiatrist, her death may not have been an accident, and strangest of all, she looked eerily like Jane herself.Firstly, I don't know what is wrong with these women. Without giving away twists, their behaviour is often outright ridiculous. Warning bells are going off left, right and centre, and they're completely oblivious. At worst, Edward is a murderer, but even at best, he's a creepy weirdo. It's almost comical how much he resembles Christian Grey - not just sexually dominant and prone to \"losing control\" but also strict about Emma and Jane's eating and exercise habits. Ick. Get out. Also, lots of people have a \"type\", but it's just plain weird if your \"type\" are all women who look virtually identical. Secondly, there is no atmosphere. I feel like the author tried to create a \"creepy house with a dark history\" feeling, but it didn't come through because so much of the book was nothing more than a weird romance. I also see how Delaney was trying to create a \"ghost of past lovers\" vibe, but this ain't no Daphne du Maurier. The writing wasn't strong enough to make you scared for the characters, to keep you metaphorically looking over your shoulder.It is often really difficult to distinguish between the two perspectives. I had to keep flicking to the beginning of the chapter to find out whether I was on Emma or Jane. This is partly because the style is impersonal and doesn't deeply connect you with the characters, but also partly because their stories are very similar. As we soon see, Edward takes them to the same places, gives them the same food, treats them the same ways - it was like reading the same perspective twice.And there's a whole bunch of subtle racism going on, as well as a bunch of other distasteful issues. If you insist on only writing about white, middle class people, don’t make the criminals/rapists black and working class. How do you not see what's wrong with that? And casual comments like this (made by a psychiatrist): \"In any relationship there are two repetition compulsions at work - his and hers.\" I can think of a whole lot of relationships where that definitely isn't true.Plus, there's a really poor and insensitive use of rape as a plot device. Without giving away spoilers, someone who was seen to be orally raped is then making jokes about preferring human sperm sacs (to fish sperm sacs - it's a long story, Japanese restaurant, blah blah). Firstly... gross. And secondly... gross.But maybe, even after all of this, I could have been persuaded to up my rating if the ending had provided us with an interesting and satisfying reveal. Unfortunately, I saw it coming from a mile away. The list of suspects is too short; the list of suspects who we'd actually care about it being is even shorter. I'm sorry, but I can't even find anything good to say about it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.560221"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.560221"]]

Is this madness ever going to end? Why can’t a book be left to stand on it’s own merits? I guess it’s my fault for giving in and picking up yet another ‘Girl’ book. Have no fear though, once again, I’ve landed in the minority, as the reviews I’ve seen have been overwhelming positive and apparently it’s being made into a movie. So, take this review with a grain of salt. It’s just one reader’s thoughts and feelings, after all.Point blank - I don’t get it. This whole scenario is strange. Odd. Completely ridiculous. What sane person would agree to live in this situation? Forget sane - why would anybody sign up for this?Maybe I’m the crazy one, but there is no way I would ever agree to give up most of my belongings to move in to a minimalistic stone box of a house that comes with over 200 stipulations. Restrictive and ridiculous rules. Not to mention, answering a bizarre questionnaire and having my “amenities” shut down every time the perfectionistic control freak of a landlord feels like I need to answer yet another series of questions. All in an effort to gauge my “growth” or acceptance of the lifestyle the house demands. I don’t care how good looking or how famous of an architect the owner is; I wouldn’t do it. The author sells the idea by garnering sympathy from the reader for the two women and the excitement of top of the line technology - it's the ultimate smart house. Both women have recently experienced tragedies and need a fresh start. And, of course, the rent for this pseudo stone cell is quite cheap. Hmm . . . I wonder why?The story unfolds through the eyes of the two women - Emma, the previous tenant, and Jane, the current tenant. The story flip-flops between then and now, which takes place two years apart, at a pretty rapid pace. We get to see how their stories mirror each other and it’s a little convoluted at times. More than once, I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose head I was in because I was kind of lost. I liked the whole notion of getting caught up in a story or your past and recreating or reliving that same story over and over. But that’s were the likes kind of ended for me.The entire plot felt like a tangled mess and not one I particularly enjoyed unraveling. Albeit, there was something about it that kept me turning the pages. I can’t say I was wowed though - not by the characters, the scenario or even the twist. I failed to see what so many others have found exceptional about this one.*THANK YOU to Random House/Ballantine Books and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.565367"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.565367"]]

The movie rights have even been sold to Universal with Ron Howard to direct. I didn't know any of that when I first read the description for the book. I just thought it sounded like an entertaining read.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"One Folgate Street in London, is a high-tech minimalist house with so many cool amenities and features that you would figure the rent would be sky-high. But the rent is actually very reasonable.So what's the catch? Well there's no catch really...Except for THE RULES!!Tenants are required to follow very a list of very strict rules. Things like no pets, paying rent on time, no loud noise after 11pm, take out the garbage. You know, things like that...NOPE...not at all like that.There are over 200 rules that tenants MUST be abide by in order to live in the house.To say that the owner/landlord of One Folgate Street is picky about who lives in the house is an understatement. To say that he's a bit particular about his rules for the tenants is putting it mildly. The rental application is extremely long and includes many bizarre (and impossible) questions.\"A person close to you confesses in confidence that they ran someone over while drunk. As a result they have given up drinking for good. Would you feel obliged to report it to the police?\"Is it worth it to live in such a beautiful high-tech home? This home with its awesome hidden gadgets. A house cleaner comes weekly. The lights, heat and cooling will set to tenants personal preferences. The shower will also adjust to their personal settings. Even the air in the house makes you feel better with its ultrasonic - mood enhancing waveforms.\"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary.\"Just don't forget.....the RULES. The main one? NO CLUTTER! Everything has its place, usually out of sight. So no pictures, no plants, no ornaments, no books....wait NO BOOKS???? (OMG!!! that's just wrong!)The owner, Edward Monkford is the architect who built the house. He also lives a minimalist lifestyle. He will not rent unless he finds the perfect tenant. But his need for control goes so much farther than that. And yet... some people are drawn to the \"tormented genius\". But who is Edward really? What happens if someone does break the rules?Emma and her boyfriend, Simon are looking for a safe place to live after a recent break-in. However, their budget is a bit tight and everything is either horrible or too expensive. Then the agent shows them One Folgate Street. She explains the lengthy process for application. Simon is hesitant but Emma feels like the place might be exactly what they need. The rules make her feel secure. She wants to reinvent herself, bring order to her life, to change and be a better person.The house may change her, but will it be for the better?We then meet Jane. After a devastating loss, Jane is looking for new place to live. She wants to make a new start and hopes that One Folgate Street is the place to do it. But it's not long before some strange things start happening. Jane learns some of the dark history of the house and is determined to find out more, especially what happened to the previous tenant.The house may be inexpensive and full of high-tech gadgets, but the walls of the house are also full of secrets. Where is the previous tenant? and is Jane in any danger?\"That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\"This book may not be for everyone. There is a lot of sex. I will definitely say that some of the characters \"turn-ons\" may be \"turn-offs\" for some readers. It wasn't really my thing and I could have done without those parts. However, it didn't really interfere with my enjoyment of the rest of the book.The chapters alternate between THEN and NOW and are narrated by Jane (NOW) and Emma (THEN). I flew through the pages. Occasionally I had to flip back to double-check whether it was Emma or Jane but most of the time I was able to keep up. The story may have been hard to believe and far-fetched at times, but I decided to try to go with the flow and enjoy it...In the end I really liked this novel. I was pulled and it got right inside my head. I had to know what was going to happen! A thrilling story about a house I would NEVER want to live in, (seriously I could not handle any of the rules) but I sure enjoyed reading about it.P.S Put your shampoo awayThank you, Ballantine Books for providing an advanced copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.568141"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.568141"]]

It is an example of extreme minimalism and incorporates the latest home technology. It was originally designed by the techno-architect Edward Monkton as his family home but his wife and son died there which means its now available for others to live. Only there is the slight problem of over 200 conditions that have to be adhered to by whoever lives there. And they have to be interviewed and approved by Monkton personally. The narrative focuses on Emma from the past, and Jane in the present. Both are troubled women. Emma was held at knife point by burglars and she is struggling to come to terms with this. This event drives her decision to apply to live in the house, despite her boyfriend, Simon's reservations. The conditions for residing there will turn her into a new person with more control, Jane has had a stillborn baby and grieving. This house will be her new start and she just happens to fancy the architect. She is receiving a flower delivery of gentians which she assumes is from the architect until she reads the card....and realises there is more to the house than she thought. Emma died in the house.A concerned Jane begins to investigate Emma, the girl before to ascertain whether she was murdered, and if so by whom. There are uncomfortable similarities between her and Emma. From both resembling Edward's wife, to having a no strings attached affair with him which runs a similar if not identical course, to both having risque sex. Jane meets the people in Emma's life including Simon, the aggrieved boyfriend, and Carol, the therapist. Meanwhile, the house appears to develop an entity of its own as strange and random things happen. Is the controlling and manipulative Edward a killer? Is Emma a reliable narrator? An air of menace hangs over the house as danger begins to close in around Jane. The writing is lucid, sparse and beautiful. Pretty much like the house, and there is an air of claustrophobia in the story. This is a house with tragic beginnings and a strong character that is destined to trouble those who live there, you can just feel this. It is a good psychological thriller that keeps you reading without ever losing interest.

The perfect house will help people reach levels of perfection they never thought they could achieve. This is the house located on One Folgate Street. The Girl Before tells the stories of Emma and Jane, two occupants who lived in One Folgate.. Emma died under mysterious circumstances while living in One Folgate Street, and Jane is the current occupant. Both women look alike, and both were involved with Edward Monkton, the architect and mastermind behind One Folgate Street--both also happen to bear an eerie resemblance to Edward’s deceased wife. Jane begins to investigate Emma’s death, and by doing so, puts herself in danger.While the premise was interesting, it felt like the author was trying to cram pieces into a puzzle that didn’t fit. As a result, everything unraveled and it all became a little ridiculous.

And that wheel keeps turning and turning throughout the entire story. Some days that wheel grinds in the down and dirty. Some days it revs up speed and gains relentless traction.Emma Matthews lives in the \"once upon a gruesome time\". Her spin in the wheel is entitled \"Then\". Emma and her boyfriend, Simon, are desperate for a safe haven after Emma is attacked in their present apartment. Fear makes you snap at quick decisions. Desperately, they apply for residency at a slick, state-of-the-art building. Even all the mind-blowing questionaires and restrictions don't deter them. No books (Ah, c'mon now!), no cushions, no placemats, no personal items left out. And they sign on the dotted line.Edward is the award winning architect and owner of this granite luxury edifice. He lost his wife and young son in a freak accident not long before. Living in Japan for a time afterwards, Edward returns to manage his property. And manage he does......quite to the nth degree.Jane Cavendish resides in the time slot entitled \"Now\". She will be the latest occupant of One Folgate Street. She recently gave birth to a stillborn little girl and has been devastated by the loss. Jane, too, is seeking solace behind the walls of this highly efficient building. Although this \"covenant\" seems highly imposing and limiting, Jane signs on the dotted line as well.Soon Jane begins to connect occurrences in her present situation to those of Emma in the past. Things just don't seem to add up. What actually happened to Emma?The Girl Before will be made into a movie by Ron Howard. It brings to mind a Julia Roberts movie (1991) called Sleeping With the Enemy. Remember how the canned goods and spices had to be stacked just so and the towels primly arranged on the rack? Oh, sweetheart, this is just the beginning......The Girl Before is one sharp-ended story that reaches deeply into the slightly tilted minds of its characters.

A thriller has not made me this excited since Megan Miranda's All the Missing Girls. The story is told in alternating chapters between Emma, the girl before, and Jane, the current tenant of a very unique flat. While both women are searching for a living situation within their budgets in expensive London, their brokers both mention a possible solution. One Folgate Street has been designed by an architectural genius, Edward Monkford, but in order to live there, one must pass a series of vetting including a multi paged questionnaire and interview. This is where things just begin to get weird. I fear saying much more will give away the twists and turns within these pages. (As an aside, Emma's chapters are told without any quotation marks in the dialogue. While it takes some time to getting used to, it is very effective in differentiating between the two women's chapters. However I am completely curious as to why the author chose to use this device, if anyone knows, fill me in.)I thoroughly enjoyed how the author portrayed One Folgate - the apartment itself takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story. There are multiple triggers within this book. I feel if I mention them here, they would be spoilers. So. Pretty much, if it's a trigger you can think of, it's here. Reader be warned!I've heard this author is writing under a pseudonym, and I am completely curious as to who masterminded this intricate story.

Then there are the other rules - hundreds of them, seemingly waiting to trip you up, catch you unawares. There are also regular questions to answer, very personal and intrusive questions.

She soon discovers that Emma met an untimely death in the house, and begins investigating just what really happened there.The narrative certainly kept my attention, I really wanted to know what happened to Emma, but I found it hard to believe in Edward, AND his rules, so really that stopped me from rating this one any higher.*Thank you to Netgalley amp; Quercus for my ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.617428"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.617428"]]

By ‘‘manipulative,’’ I mean you’re more than pushed into liking specific characters and disliking others. So you do that. But despite having your thoughts about characters shaped by the author, you’re still manipulated some more as the story progresses. I don’t exactly like when that happens. I prefer to be exposed to all facets of someone’s personality and then be able to decide for myself who deserves justice and who doesn’t. This mystery novel is engrossing, despite it not giving us the liberty of making our own opinions on the protagonists and antagonists until the very end. The short chapters surely had their role to play in my being unable to put this book down.It’s slow, partly because it’s a mystery novel. If you’re familiar with the genre, you know that these types of novels take time to pick up because it’s all about the building part. It takes time for Jane to discover someone died in the house and it takes time for Emma to feel scared. That’s when things really become interesting.The death thing confused me, since I thought real estate agents were supposed to disclose info like that – especially when the previous tenants have died. But I guess there are places where no such law exists. Bummer, but it worked in the author’s favour. I enjoyed seeing this book shift from mystery to psychological thriller. I’m definitely the type to enjoy action in my plots, so I couldn’t do anything else but welcome the darker side of THE GIRL BEFORE, even if it takes time to reach that point. The characters also take time to become important in the reader’s eyes; most likely because they seem so normal, but that’s probably done on purpose to give the effect that this kind of story could happen to you or me. Anyone at all. But don’t worry; it’s very, very unlikely. Sleep tight now.

It was built by a techno-minimalist architect named Edward Monkford. There is an intense 200-question application, a face-to-face interview with the ones Edward personally approves, and even then..they rarely get the lease. And if you do, you have to live by strict rules and adapt to this minimalist lifestyle. It is all in the contract. Things like no children or pets, no curtains or rugs, everything must be put away at all times (including dishes, clothes, etc), no books, nothing left out on floors, no flatbed furniture, etc. Plus you’re required to keep the same cleaning service on, must open the house to visitors for architecture tours, and must take assessments every month to see how you change throughout your stay at One Folgate Street.Not my cup of tea to live under such a strict lifestyle. The two women in this story both went through a trauma before needing to find somewhere new to live on a budget. And One Folgate Street is a house that allows for people to live beyond their means (in terms of rent). Emma and Simon recently had a break in, so Emma needs to feel safe. Emma is the girl from then.And Jane’s chapters are marked now. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is reeling from the loss. For Jane the house feels like it could be a fresh start.

I’m just looking at how it worked into the plot and some scenes felt like added length as they added nothing to the story.The ending felt somewhat tame, though it was still satisfying. I guess it wasn’t as explosive as I was hoping. I liked the random application questions that were thrown in the story sporadically.

The sampler measured in as 17% of the total book, which is quite lengthy portion and definitely had my intrigue piqued. There are so many physiological thrillers available today that sell themselves as in the style of Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins. Very few actually come close to living up to the powerhouses in this genre. This book, however, deserves to sit beside them. This dark and brooding tale was alive with emotion and drew the reader into the tension of the tale. The story wasn't set out in chronological order and this provided room for the tale to slowly unfurl, and share its secrets with the reader at its own pace. The telling of the tale, as well as the setting of it, were as alive as the characters, and all three worked together to provide something suspenseful, shocking and totally unique!First ReadingI received this in exchange for an honest review from NetGalley. Thank you to the author, J.P. Delaney, and the publisher, Ballantine Books, for this opportunity.I have never read a sample of a book before and, to be honest, have never been interested in doing so. When I received an email proclaiming that I was eligible for a portion of this book I downloaded it to my Kindle without any real idea of when or if I would get to it. One day, however, I found myself short of time and eager for a quick read to finish, which is how I ended picking this up.I was hooked from the very first page! This sample contains a considerable quantity of the book, containing approximately twenty short chapters, and I flew through all of it in one sitting.Told from the split perspectives of Emma, in the past, and Jane, in the present, this chronicles the similar paths both their lives took once they became the occupant of the infamous 1 Folgate Street. Designed by cutting-edge architect, Edward Monketon, this house is unlike any other. And Monketon requires his tenants to live their life unlike any other, as well.This is the absolute definition of spine-tingling! This managed to make a modern house, full of straight lines and futuristic technology feel like a chilling, Gothic mansion, full of shadowed corners and ghosts of homeowners past. And all without dwelling on any of the melodrama associated with that genre.The no-nonsense style of writing mirrors the architect of the house and becomes just as much a function of the tale as the characters and the setting.I am so eager to uncover the mysteries concerning this unique and compelling thriller and can't wait until I can get the rest of the book in my hands!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.628956"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.628956"]]

I’m just loving these imaginative psychological thrillers coming out recently!!While this appears to be a debut novel, this author apparently has some experience with crime writing, having written this book under a pseudonym. I wish I knew who the ‘crime writer’ is- but I suppose that’s a mystery for another day. In the meantime, I hear this book might be the basis for a movie, and Ron Howard would be the director! So, if that isn’t enough to peak your interest, I don’t know what will. While this is yet ANOTHER book for ‘fans of ‘Gone Girl’ and ‘The Girl on the Train’, and yes, it does have the requisite ‘Girl’ in the title, this book stands on its own merits and needs no other comparison.Two very different women, both having suffered emotional traumas, move in, at different times, into a very affordable, unique, technologically advanced apartment that stresses a minimalist lifestyle. The apartment’s owner screens his tenants by having them fill out a lengthy questionaire, and insists they sign a contract promising to adhere to a strict set of rules… around two hundred of them,(!!!) and if they are not obeyed there will be conseqences. The story alternates between the first person perspectives of Emma and Jane as they describe their time living in Edward Monkford’s apartment building. As the story progresses, we learn the two women bear a striking resemblance to one another, are both attracted to Edward, despite his OCD tendencies, but, Jane discovers that the previous tenant… Emma, died in the apartment, an apparent victim of suicide. Jane becomes somewhat obsessed with Emma and her backstory, while her own personal relationship with Edward begins to deepen. But, her investigation into Emma’s death could come back to haunt her….While it may seem obvious who ‘the girl before’ is, and some may guess correctly, I admit I didn’t see the twist coming and was completely surprised by the way the story developed. The suspense is low key initially, with just a mild creepy feeling permeating the sterile environment the two women live in. But, as the story develops, a feeling of dread begins to grow, and before too long, I found myself immersed in these women’s lives, wanting to send out a warning signal, to advise caution, but didn't know who or what the main threat was. The writing is superb, as the author drew me in, held my attention, managing to evoke feelings of concern for the tenants, on top of creating the feeling of foreboding and dread, that kept me turning those pages. Of the two women, one is more controversial and the other is mildly bland, and were not necessarily people I related to or felt a kinship with, but I did feel sympathy for them and worried on their behalf, despite feeling frustrated with them at times.I was slightly conflicted by the ending, which was somewhat anticlimactic, in my opinion. Other than that, I thought this was a pretty solid thriller, with a unique set up, and kept me interested from beginning to end. 4 stars"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.631157"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.631157"]]

With a list of over 200 conditions that have to be strictly adhered to by whoever lives there and a very thorough interview process for would be tenants it is proving difficult to lease. The story focuses on two troubled women who live at 1 Folgate Street, Emma from the past, and Jane in the present.For the first half of the book I was totally hooked and read the novel at every possible opportunity. It was easy to see why this book was getting so much positive attention and plans to bring to the big screen so far advanced. I was already thinking this book was going to get a high rating off me but then I don't know what exactly changed but my interest suddenly dwindled. I totally understand why other reviewers are raving about it and I am pretty sure I will watch the film when released but unfortunately I didn't find the second half of the novel anywhere as powerful as the opening.I would like to thank Net Galley and Quercus books for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.633510"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.633510"]]

Both women had some sort of superbadawful they were trying to get over when an opportunity to reside at One Folgate Street presented itself.

I mean, first of all, it had the word \"Girl\" in the title, which was a clue that it would be bandwaggoning the tail end of a trend. And then, once I finished reading it, I found Emily May's review that made the connection between this book and Fifty Shades of Grey.Here is a list of all of the things I hated about this book:1. Edward. His character was completely unconvincing. I haven't read FSoG and I have no plans to do so. However, that book has permeated the pop culture to the level that even I was able to draw the parallels between his character and Christian Grey. \"I don't do traditional relationships,\" he purred, smoothly. \"I'm coming over, and I'm going to take you to bed,\" he told her (completely out of the blue, by the way). If a man said that to me, I'd meet him at the door with a sledgehammer and a restraining order. Not that Jane would have a sledgehammer, since it's probably a violation of the preposterous rules that she agreed to before moving into the house to have a sledgehammer. 2. BDSM. Never have I been so unconvinced of spanking in a book. Never.3. BDSM. When Emma called him \"daddy\" it literally came out of nowhere. The ultimate sexual non sequitur. Where in the hell did that come from? 4. Emma. Shut your fucking face you lying liar who lies. Honestly, she was one of the most unlikeable female characters in any book ever. She lied about everything. Everything that made her sympathetic turned out to be entirely false. There were three sociopaths in this book, and she was one of them. Are we supposed to like her? I'm unclear on this point.5. Jane. She is basically the equivalent of that dumb blonde in a horror movie who hides behind the wall of whirling knives instead of running the fuck away while she can. 6. It's treatment of trauma was totally surface and entirely based on the author's idea of what some one who has experienced trauma might do. 7. The house itself was entirely creepy and no one would ever live there. People who are alive, and who are not wax statues, do things that create clutter and mess. Even the tidiest house will have, at a minimum, a family photo displayed. Living in that house would be like living in a mausoleum. No one would voluntarily live in a mausoleum before they had actually become a corpse.8. The twist. I figured it out. Go away.9. The dual narrations in opposing chapters. Tired. Trite. Been done.10. The ending. Nice gimmick.So, yeah, there really wasn't anything I liked about this book. I should've known better, really, than to buy it. But can this trend of unrealistic characters and their behaviors in \"realistic\" fiction be over now, please?

I thought I knew within the first few chapters, but I was wrong--and I'm not telling, sorry.One Folgate Street seems to be the perfect place for those wanting a decent home, yet can't afford one... but it has a strange ability to change it's residents.... The house was designed that way... with a computer system running all the facilities, and interrupting lives at the most inopportune moment, with questionnaires to answer--to see if the tenant(s) are progressing properly. This computer system, called Housekeeper had several beneficial aspects to the home owner...recognizing who was in the shower, and their water preferences, noticing the amount of REM sleep they got, checking their stress levels....and more. Two women are each searching for a place to begin again. Emma, wants security after being violently burgled. Jane has just suffered the stillbirth of a perfect child due to hospital neglect, and needs to move on after quitting her high-paying job, and more importantly, leave the constant reminders that fill her present home of poor little Isabelle. The major problem both face are the terrible price of London flats, and the horrible state of those they can afford.Enter Edward Monkford, a gorgeous, controlling perfectionist with plans* for his architecture to change the lives of those who inhabit his pristine, mausoleum like, architecture. (His idea of architecture and life had changed drastically after the tragic death of his wife and son on the grounds of the building site, but few know of the ancient Japanese ritual that also took place there....) This house is built of only the best materials and is stunningly beautiful in it's minimalism. No wonder it's won awards. The walls are smooth pale stone, all appliances and fixtures hidden from the naked eye...Usually only the rich can afford his places, so why is this place so cheap? Because there's a catch. It begins with a huge questionnaire, with numerous, often seemingly odd questions that must be answered by any prospective tenants. Once finished with that process they are then made aware of a lengthy list of rules that would make life unbearable for most, even if smitten enough with the pristine, beautiful, award winning property to sign the list of rules (including no throw pillows, personal pictures, or books, just to name a few-this house is meant to bring order, peace, and better overall health to the lives of those who live inside). There were other rights to sign over in the lengthy small-typed package, a contract that the exhausted hopeful applicants rarely had the energy left to read closely. The final request was to send three recent pictures upon submittal. There was no secret that most hopefuls are quickly rejected by email--that precious few make it through the lengthy process and acquire an interview--the last hurdle. Not until later does someone take notice of a striking resemblance the accepted tenants bear--not only to each other--but also to Edward's dead wife. All attractive, with the unusual combination of dark hair, porcelain skin, and deep blue eyes.Emma and Jane both have that advantageous resemblance, and can't believe their fortune when chosen to live in this stunning, albeit artfully sparse, masterpiece house for only a pittance. They have no idea of the plans the architect has for them, and that they have become human guinea pigs.One of the best parts of this book for me is it's POV, which is separated by chapters. We have Then: Emma, and Now: Jane. Emma had lived in the house before Jane, but ends up dead. I thought she must be the girl before. In a way she was. When Jane finds out about her, this thriller becomes a chilling mystery. As the POV's are first person, the story of Emma is a bit difficult because she is a very unreliable narrator, causing us to believe her lies, until the story unwinds enough to see who she really is. I loved the way these two stories were interwoven, one picking up quickly where the other had just left off. In no way were these hard to follow, rather the tension mounted as the reader realized there was something strange about their commonality, namely--Edward. I found it ingenious the way they fit together, and especially creepy as on some of the pages there was only a question, either from the computer check-ups, or the original form, that was particularly relevant to the situation going on. These chapter endings served to keep me engrossed in the book, feeling the need to read the next one to find out more.(view spoiler)[Emma moved in with her boyfriend Simon--who passionately loved her--after the burglary that terrified her in her old neighborhood. Most personal items were not allowed in this clean lined house (one of the MANY rules), only a few items of clothing, some toiletries. Simon was not crazy to give up his beloved possessions, but Simon loved Emma far more, so he went along with it, as he always went along with Emma, wanting to make her happy. But soon, Emma is changing, she kicks Simon out, whom she thought she needed desperately weeks before. It's then that Edward enters her life....Yet, Emma had another problem: lies. She's told them to everyone, Simon, the police, the court, and Edward. To get out of the mess some of her lies have caused, she tells more lies--about people, lies that change their lives; and when she ends up dead...no one knows where to turn....the list of suspects is incredibly long, and her case remains unsolved unsolved.When Jane moves in, she is comfortable living in the home's simplicity. It's a new start. One in which Edward also becomes entangled. Soon, she finds out about Emma, and the resemblance (as well as the story of Edward's wife). Her time is spent trying to piece together Emma's death. It's a course that leads her into danger. I loved to watch her amateur crime solving, as she meets many of the people from Emma's past; but there are far too many suspects to get her mind around. Her life becomes endangered when the true murderer gains access to her house (again...not the one I expected), and a terrifying night of hide and seek follows, with fear around every corner; the reader can't help but hold their breath as the pages turn and mysteries are solved. Can Jane overcome the murderer? Or will she end up as Emma had? Another dark haired, blue eyed girl spilling her life-blood on the immaculate stone of this house? Jane actually holds a prize...one in which we find the true meaning of who The Girl Before really is. Can she keep the prize and escape this house, alive?

I went into the book without a lot of expectations. I decided to read this book based on the summary which sounded like it had the making of a good thriller. It turns out that I was hooked by the story almost immediately and found myself doing that thing where I promise that I will read just one more chapter and before I knew it, I had read half the book. This books tells two stories from two different timelines. Emma and Jane have both lived at the house at One Folgate Street. One Folgate Street is not your average house. It is a house with rules. Lots of rules. Rules that most people wouldn't even want to try to follow. If a potential tenant decides that they want to live in the house, the approval process is quite difficult and most are turned away. Emma and Jane were both approved. Emma moved in the house first with her boyfriend, Simon. Later, Jane moves in and learns that Emma died in the house.Both Emma and Jane were going through some very troubling issues when they moved into the house and hoped the move would give them the fresh start they want. Emma and Jane were both very interesting characters. I wouldn't say that I ever really liked them but I really became invested in learning what happened to Emma and wondered what would happen to Jane. The other key character in this book, Edward, was similar in that I didn't really like his characters but I couldn't help myself from wondering what he would do next.The way this book was laid out really worked well. The chapters alternated from Emma and Jane's point of view with Jane spending a lot of energy trying to learn what had happened to Emma. Sometimes the reader would see something happen to Emma just to have it happen to Jane in the next chapter. Instead of feeling redundant, it just added an extra layer to the story. The more that Jane became obsessed with finding out about Emma the more hooked I became. This was a book that was incredibly hard to set aside.My only complaint about the book is that I am not completely sold on the ending. I do like that the book took a lot of twists and turns that I didn't expect. For some reason the ending felt like a bit of a let down for me. I think that I had expected a bigger scene to help wrap everything up. I would highly recommend this book to fans of mystery thrillers. This book grabbed my interest from the first page and never let go. I look forward to reading more from J.P.

The Gone Girl comp is painful for me. That book is my favourite of 2013, and one of my favourite books of all time; I was incredibly excited about this book, not because of that comp, but because of the interesting amp; exciting premise. Unfortunately, the result is more like 50 Shades of Grey meets a pale, brutally-murdered corpse of Gone Girl.50 Shades of Grey? Yep, there's a devilishly handsome, accomplished architect that neither of the two (lame, weak, poorly-developed) women are able to resist; there's BDSM; there's even a frigging contract. I'll tell you this, though, guys: I've had more erotic headaches than this book. Seriously, this book is so replete with awful erotica cliches, I was cringing throughout, from such golden lines as:Yes please, Daddy.Or Edward, the architect, sticking his finger up some woman's vagina in the middle of a massive society party for famous architects (or something), and causing her to go weak at the knees with the daring amp; impossibility of this all.The problem is, there's potential here - real potential. I loved the description of One Folgate Street, and a few of the set pieces, such as when Jane finds Emma's sleeping bag abandoned in a hideaway in the house. I loved the idea, and the continued ideas - especially Edward's interrogation of Jane through his \"questions.\" I thought Jane's final decision was lovely and moving, and pointed towards a wholly different, quieter, but BETTER novel lurking inside the empty, glassy shell of this one: a contemporary novel about one woman's (not two's) impossible choices, longing for a child, and conflict with the control-freak father of that child. However, this book shows, frankly, what a wonderful success Gone Girl is, and why it's been so hard to repeat (except with The Girl on the Train, which had the luxury of at least being an entirely different novel behind the \"Girl\" veneer). The characters here are not well-developed; what was so wonderful about Gone Girl was its utterly unique ability to keep the twists within the focus of what we already knew about the characters. When Gone Girl twisted, it felt like whole new possibilities jumped up within the range of what we had already been teased amp; knew. In The Girl Before, on the other hand, characters are kept ambiguous and dully unlikeable in order for anything to be possible. Worse than that, though, when The Girl Before runs out of places to go, it lurches haphazardly into cliche and a straight-up Gone Girl ripoff, unfortunately borrowing the worse aspect of it: (view spoiler)[Flynn's penchant for false rape accusations, a pattern which is almost exactly duplicated here, with Emma falsely accusing not just one man but THREE SUCCESSIVE MEN of raping her (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.663384"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.663384"]]

Not something I could ever do, by the way. I love my possessions, especially my books. And no pets? Never. But anyway….The story is told in alternating chapters between past and present. Both women who chose the house have suffered loss or harm - a break-in while she was home by one and the loss of an unborn child by the other. So, they have their reasons for choosing something so different. In between the chapters, there are questions from the questionnaire the landlord gives prospective tenants, just so you can see how strange it all really is. This book was a mixed message for me. Some ideas were interesting, like the Japanese cultural ideas that Edward espouses. Or Jane’s comparing of her relationship with Edward to palimpsest or pentimento. But other things just really freaked me out. Like ikizukuri, which is just barbaric. I know, I'm freaked out at the idea of eating live seafood when this is a book about murder. But that sort of thing really sets the tone. There's also a dominance and sex theme. Not talking 50 Shades here, but the man having all the control and calling all the shots. Just not my cup of tea. I had no fondness for any of the main characters either. There's a decent twist towards the end of the book that keeps it interesting and then the ending is positively wild and engrossing. I'm really torn how to rate this. The first ¾ of the book was two stars, but the last ¼ was close to a four for excitement. Guess I'm going with a three. And what is it with the use of “girl” in titles, for pete’s sake? Emma is a woman. My thanks to netgalley and Ballantine Books for an advance copy of this book.

Perhaps he needs a fancy stay at a \"resort\" with soft walls because he's Looney tunes, orrrr maybe he just needs a stiff drink and a good psychiatrist. Either way, he's on the short list of possible suspects when one of the tenants dies in the house that's creepy enough to make you consider staying at the Bates Motel instead. Cue the scary piano/violin combo.The book is written with alternating chapters from the pov of the dead woman as well as the new tenant who is on a quest to find out the truth about what really happened in that house.So, needless to say... It's 2:25 am, and I'm scared to go to sleep. Because I finished this book. I had a whole bunch of mental notes I'd thought of, so I could point out all the unique and down right intriguing aspects of this story,but...that flew out the window, along with my sense of adult logic that tells me not to be afraid of the dark, or of the boogeyman that may or may not be lurking somewhere in the shadows. It's not my fault, it was this nailbiting story that frightened me because I couldn't figure it out. Usually authors give away teensy morsels that tantalize readers and allow them to have a strong suspicion about who's doin' what to whom, and who the psycho is. But oh no, not this time. J.P. Delaney is a talented lil sneak who knows how to make you feel like a 5 year-old hidden under the covers like a scaredy cat. If you enjoy adrenaline-inducing stories, you will love this one. It's complicated, has more twists and turns than a winding road, and the characters are a psychoanalyst's wet dream. Delaney must've done years of research to perfect the complexities of these characters. I'm not just saying that, either. If you choose to read this, you'll know exactly what I mean, because the knowledge in this book regarding a multitide of topics is nothing short of impressive.Normally I don't compare books, but it's safe to say that if you love books like The Girl On The Train, Before I Go To Sleep, Disclaimer or Gone Girl, then you will love this one too.Thanks to Netgalley for letting me read this in exchange for an honest review.

A novel that gained the eyes of editors around the world at the Frankfurt Book Fair and a bidding war started based on 53 pages. A soon to be made movie by Ron Howard. The story of a house and the women who lived in it. The past Emma and the present Jane. The narrative splitting between both characters; in many cases the story repeats itself and you see it from two different point of views. The owner of the house; the minimalist architect Edward and his over 200 stipulations to live in this house. A house that electronically control the environment, the light, the sounds, a house where you can't bring your life in to. I wasn't a fan of Emma she felt too weak and had no power whatsoever over the men in her life, I wanted to scream and shout and tell her to be stronger and not a weak person. Jane develops and evolves with the story and she grows on you. You feel her happiness and pain. Edward on the other hand is cold as ice... a perfectionist control freak, that I wouldn't know why any woman would want to be with him. Why should a woman be fine in living in a house that would cut off her water if she didn't put the dishes back or if she didn't clean the shampoo stain or some other reason... it makes no logical sense and it's 2017. It was a book that flowed nice even if it didn't make sense in some points, and in other parts the author did give early clues for future events that made them less enjoyable. It was a good book and I can see why people would buy it when it comes out."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.684525"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.684525"]]

I love reading reviews from my fellow book bloggers because I trust their opinions and know they won’t spoil anything for me, but on Goodreads/Amazon you just never know. All that being said, I had heard that The Girl Before was getting mixed reactions so I checked things out for myself and it seems people either love this book or they hate it. I happened to love it, but just know that it seems like it’s not for everyone. You have dual perspectives here, Emma is Then, Jane is Now. This style never fails to reel me in and by ten percent I was totally hooked. Emma and her boyfriend Simon move into One Folgate Street together, then two years later Jane moves in alone to start fresh after a tragedy. As the chapters flip back and forth, the similarities between the two women are frighteningly uncanny. One of the biggest complaints that I’ve seen about this book is that no one finds the premise believable. One Folgate Street is owned by an architect named Edward who is a rigid perfectionist to put it mildly. He’s created a sterile, modern home with new technology that’s amazing but also creepy. No house keys are needed, the shower remembers what temperature you prefer, etc. The application prospective tenants must fill out in order to be considered has two hundred questions. That’s right, TWO hundred and they are anything but typical. They require the applicant to answer moral dilemmas and they’re just very odd. He also requires a picture which is just bizarre. Would I ever want to live in a place with a tyrannical control freak as a landlord? No thank you. But as a premise for a book I thought it was fabulous and it didn’t bother me that it wasn’t exactly believable.Beyond what I’ve already discussed I won’t say more about the plot. This was a highly addictive and provocative read for me, a real page turner about the quest for perfection and the obsession that goes hand in hand with it. I was blindsided by one of the major twists and the smaller ones threw me for a loop as well. I can’t wait to see this play out on the big screen as Ron Howard is directing, I think it’ll be fantastic! Again, this seems to be a really polarizing read, you’ll either love it or hate it. If you’ve read it I would love to see which side of the fence you fall on!

After his wife and child died there in a tragic accident, (or was it?) Edward decides to rent the home, but only to those who pass his strict and lengthy interview process.

Jane, who recently lost a child and feels the stark blank walls are just what she needs to help recover, and Emma, the notorious 'Girl Before'.There are moments of great intensity here, but also there were some chapters that fell flat, which is part of why this didn't cut it as a 5 star for me. The other reason is that I really didn't like any of the characters, which made it hard for me to feel any kind of sympathy for their plights. I was hoping for a better ending, although to be honest I can't say just how, so it probably is the best ending possible.

Delaney"], ["date", "Nov 30, 2016"], ["review_text", "I received a copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest review.The Girl Before started out great. It's an addicting psychological thriller about two unrelated women who both, at different times, agree to move into an experimental house designed by minimalist architect Edward Monkford. The house comes with a long set of rules: no clutter, no children, no pets. Nothing but the absolutely essential. Chapters alternate between their perspectives following two different timelines; we have Then: Emma and Now: Jane. Though the young women don't know each other, their narratives parallel and we see Jane falling into the same patterns and making the same choices as Emma did, lending the story a tense air of inevitability - it's like watching two trains about to collide, and it's terrifying.This started out being one of the creepiest thrillers I've read in a long time. I raced through the pages in order to get to the bottom of the mystery. And then it all went downhill.I try my best to write my reviews without spoilers, but all of my problems with this book come down to the twists and reveals, so without further ado:(view spoiler)[1. Emma lying about being raped. On the one hand, I love unreliable narrators, especially in this genre. The fact of Emma being a pathological liar is fascinating, and it's fun trying to wade through her web of deceit to discern the truth. But then we arrive here, and... well. What a letdown. I'm not saying that false rape accusations don't happen. But in a society where allegations of rape are often met with scorn and skepticism, where alleged rapists are let out of prison after six months because of promising athletic careers or even appointed president of the United States, do we really need more fictional accounts of women lying about being raped? Especially seeing as the biggest name in this genre from recent years also focuses on a false rape accusation, it stings even more seeing it repeated here. Once was enough. (I won't name the title because of spoilers, but I think we all know what I'm talking about.)2. The reveal that Simon was the killer. This is one of the rare cases where I think I would have preferred the killer to be the person we all guessed it was on page one, rather than this outlandish twist. In Edward Monkford we have a fascinating and terrifying depiction of a narcissist and a sociopath, someone who seems from the outset perfectly capable of murder. While it seemed a bit too obvious that he was the killer, I couldn't help but to expect it. I wanted to see what drove him to that point, what was enough to make him snap. Even though I thought I had this book figured out, I didn't care. It was still addicting and tense and my heart raced as I tore through the pages, waiting for the final pieces of Edward murdering Emma to click into place. But no, it turns out that Edward's just a bit of an eccentric weirdo, and boring and possessive Simon is secretly crazy enough to murder the woman he loves. Simon was a jerk, there's no doubt about that, but I still didn't really buy this. Something that writers of the thriller genre fail to grasp is that sometimes less is more. Sometimes a bit of predictability is okay if your characters and situations are unique enough, which was certainly the case here. Readers are just as likely to enjoy a book because of its vivid characters - and Edward is certainly that - as unexpected plot twists. Twists like this need to strike a balance between shocking and believable in order to be effective, and this one relied too heavily on the former. 3. Down Syndrome being equated with imperfection and Jane being forced to choose between the epitome of perfection in the house and her 'imperfect' baby... really????? Could we not have told this story without going here??? [note: edited on 12/12/16. I originally incorrectly stated that the baby had autism, while it actually is Down Syndrome, as someone reminded me in the comments. I apologize for the error - I hadn't had the book with me at the time I wrote this review and was going off memory.] (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.709308"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.709308"]]

Unfortunately although I really did enjoy The Girl Before it didn’t turn out to be the “thrilling” read I was expecting. The story is told by two narrators Jane who moves into the perfect house, or is it? There are so many rules and regulations (200 in fact!) some of which are bizarre to say the least, and then other chapters are told from Emma’s POV whose mysterious death, becomes central to the plot. As the past and present become entwined you really can’t help wondering where the plot is heading. One Folgate Street is not a place I would choose to live in that’s for sure, with an obsessive and controlling landlord you just know things aren’t going to end well.The characters in The Girl Before aren’t the most likeable characters I’ve come across they are manipulative, selfish and self absorbed, but I must admit I was eager to learn more about them, and to see how the connection between characters would pan it. There are so many lies and half truths surrounding the two protagonists I found it difficult to know what to believe, but it certainly made me dislike them even more when the author reveals them. As Jane realises her life is running parallel to the tragic Emma’s events take a dark and sinister turn. Interestingly One Folgate Street takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story, which sounds strange but it actually adds a sense of malice and claustrophobia to its tale.Although I read this book in a day, and the plot is highly original personally I found the ease that the two women fall for their landlord less than credible, some scenes read more like 50 shades than a psychological thriller! When I picked up The Girl Before the first couple of chapters hint at the malice and darkness that surround the house, so I was expecting at least a few OMG moments, but unfortunately they never materialised. Don’t get me wrong it was an easy book to pick it up and read in one sitting as It did have elements that I enjoyed I’m sure The Girl Before will be loved by many, but even after the big reveal I was left feeling slightly disappointed as I expected so much more."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.716958"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.716958"]]

Emma, who lives there first, ends up dying under mysterious circumstances. The case can't conclusively decide whether her death was an accident, a suicide, or murder. Jane moves in a little more than a year later, after the apartment had been vacant for a year. As she gets settled in, she learns about Emma, and starts doing a little digging into her death. She quickly comes to find that Emma looks a lot like her, and that they both had relationships with the same man - the architect of the house. One Folgate Street is an architectural masterpiece. It's entirely integrated with technology, and is a beautiful home. That said, in order to live there, there are 200 rules that the tenant has to abide by. Yes, you read that right. 200! Including no books, pictures, or personal items. In addition to agreeing to the rules, in order to live in the apartment, tenants have to fill out a long survey, send in pictures, and complete an in person interview before getting approved. Why anyone would agree to all of that is beyond me. Give up my books?! No, thank you.The Girl Before is positioned as a thriller, though personally, I found it really slow moving. I didn't dislike the build up, but the story didn't feel like a thriller at all (and barely even felt like a mystery) until more than 70% into the book. Details and revelations come very very slowly, and leave the reader little room to guess what happened and what the end of the book would entail. What I did enjoy reading about were the details of the house. While I could never in a million years live in a house with that many rules, the technology the house employed was amazing. Windows that automatically darkened depending on the time of day? Shower heads that were responsive by person and knew the exact water temperature you liked? Yes, please! I also enjoyed that the story alternated between Emma and Jane, so we were able to understand both women and what happened to them as it was happening. That said, their voices sounded identical. It was really difficult to tell them apart, and I found myself flipping back and forth to chapter titles so I could remember whose part I was reading a few times. All in all, I did like the book. I loved the twists and turns that happened in the last 30% of the book. I felt like that's when it really turned into a thriller! The resolution was great, and I really loved the ending and final revelations! If you're looking for a book that's instant action from page one, this isn't the book for you. If you're comfortable with something slow building but interesting and willing to wait a while for the action, definitely pick this one up! I would rate this 3.5 stars if half stars were a thing on Goodreads. Because I loved the last 20%, I'll round up for Goodreads purposes.The Girl Before will be released on January 24, 2017. Thank you to NetGalley, J.P. Delaney, and Random House Bellantine for this eARC in exchange for an honest review.

I started reading and was hooked, so I went ahead and bought it.Five gritty, difficult stars for this whirlwind. I feel so used. I loved the first third of the book, hated the second, and decided that it was all horribly necessary at the end.I debated with four stars because I thought everyone in this book was gross. Even Jane. Not at first, at first I thought she was smart and mature and a really relatable, regular woman. But then she started making appointments with people to find out information and then challenging them when they told her what they knew. Like what? Why are you seeking people out just to argue with them?But as it turns out, all of it was necessary. Edward's ridiculous personality, the house rules that most (all?) independent women would find abominable, the terrible, sad situations that caused these women to allow themselves to be governed, the super graphic sex scenes that take the non-erotica-reading audience by surprise, the selfishness of every. single. person in this book. It is all so staunchly apparent 2/3 of the way through that I found myself really questioning the author's integrity. Why would Delaney hook me like that, get me to pay for the book, and then make me hang out with stupid, annoying, crazy people for the remainder?Well, because (s)he is a genius. As all my initial opinions started falling apart, I started tearing through the book harder. Not so much to find out the ending, but to find out if I'd really been duped. And I thought I had until the very last few pages.What a hell of an ending. After I finished it, I sat around thinking for a long time. I really wanted to give it four stars because I'm still disgusted by everything. But you see, that was the point.Not only that, I was dragged through all these undesirable emotions voluntarily. Someone was controlling my actions, my thoughts, my opinions the whole time, making me think I needed to keep going. But I kept on with it. I kept putting myself through it.

It's already being adapted into a movie, there is a lot of hype, and most people seemed to love it. I wasn't a fan of the frequently changing perspective. The premise of the book - although seriously far-fetched - was unique and the plot really was intriguing. My main issue, I couldn't get excited about any of the characters. They all just left me feeling....pretty much nothing. The one scene that triggered some emotion was the one involving food (if you've read this, you'll probably know what I mean).

There are obviously several twists and turns, and I enjoyed the latter half of the book more while other reviewers actually seemed to prefer the first half.

Most enigmatic is the architect – possibly of more things than just buildings, so the scene is set for a tense and fascinating story.So we get told both stories in alternate timelines – Emma, the girl before of the title and Jane, the current occupant of a house that will divide opinion on whether or not you would like to live in it. Both Emma and Jane definitely do but there are all sorts of hoops to jump through and for Emma it is not going to go so well….This is a clever, twisty and intelligent thriller that leads you down one path then another, exposes each character slowly but surely until you see who they actually are, it is a tense and fascinating build up to a finale that exposes the true colours of everyone involved. In the background, stark and watchful is this place they occupy, a modern and utterly engaging home that sounds both heavenly and irritating in equal measure.Great writing here – really really immersive, descriptively gorgeous, utterly creepy in some parts and an honest to God page turner.

There is an extensive application asking strange questions and then a private interview with the architect if the applicant makes it that far. There is a thick contract listing hundreds of rules that must be followed in order to live there. Who would want to live like that? The house is minimalist to the extreme although every item is top of the line. There is technology up the ying yang and a housekeeper and a gardener. Everything must be perfect. The computer system keeps track of you and even controls the shower temperature and your body's functions like blood pressure. There will be times when questionnaires must be completed. Until they are completed the house shuts down- no water, heat etc.  It didn't appeal to me at all but there are plenty of interested people.

Moving in even after finding a long list of rules to follow to rent the home Jane still believes this is the fresh start she needs. However, Jane finds herself becoming fascinated with finding out what happened to One Folgate Street's former resident Emma. Finding that Emma died within the walls of her new home Jane can't help but investigate to find out the truth for herself before she follows along in Emma's footsteps. The Girl Before is told from alternating points of view between Jane, the current tenant, in the present and Emma, the former tenant in the past. There are often times that there is no clear distinction with dialogue by use of quotations but this really didn't bother this reader at all. I found the story to be immediately gripping and intense as I learned what brought these two women into this home. Both characters in this story are coming from rough times in their lives and needing a new start. When shown the home at One Folgate Street they are told there is a long list of rules to live in the home anywhere from no books to no curtains or changes made to the home. Thinking that a new start is more important than possessions the contract is quickly signed by both and that is where the intensity begins. Now while I didn't quite find this a perfect read in my opinion as there were some things happening that I didn't quite agree with being added into the story I still found myself quite compelled with this one to give it four stars in the end. I'd certainly recommend checking this one out to the thriller fans.

To be granted lease, you must fill in a laborious questionnaire and attend a face-to-face meeting with Edward himself, and even then, you’re unlikely to be approved. There are a large number of rules you have to abide by when you live in the house, such as, no books (?!?!?!), no rugs, no curtains, and no leaving things out, such as clothes, toiletries etc, to name a few. You must also open your home for tours every so often and complete various questionnaires/assessments throughout your stay.So, I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking “who the hell would agree to that?” but as it happens, two women choose to live at One Folgate Street. Thanks to its low rent and dishy architect, both Jane and Emma are happy putting up with all the rules. Jane is the girl from now, and Emma is the girl before. Both women are troubled and both begin a relationship with architect Edward.What follows is a novel full of mystery and sex. If you’re also not into the whole “daddy” thing then this won’t be for you.Starting off this book, I was very worried I was going to hate it, because I’d seen a lot of people say the focus on kinky sex as a bit left field and overpowering to the plot. But, I managed to get over that when it started to appear in the story. In my opinion, it wasn’t as bad as many people had made it out to be and in any case, you can always skip over it. I thought it was going to go full 50 Shades at some moments, but it managed to avoid any of the scenes becoming too tactless.The mystery of “the girl before” is certainly intriguing and kept me hooked (for the first half, at least). I liked the way this was set out as Emma (before) and Jane (now) and how the chapters often mirrored each other so we could see the similarities in each of the tenants lives and relationships with Edward.What I didn’t like about this book was the characters, which I’m kind of assuming was the goal by Delaney? If not, then he/she (does anyone know and can inform me on their gender?) is pretty terrible at creating characters. Although Edward is set up to be our “villain”, I found Emma to be the most dislikable character, even after all was said and done. She was manipulative, unnecessarily forward, obnoxious and total putty in Edward’s hands. Women who can’t act on their own accord because of a man infuriate me, which is probably why I didn’t get on with this novel that well, as it’s kind of what the whole plot is about. I like my women strong and independent! The ending of this novel, no word of a lie, infuriated me. What a total cop out. People are comparing this to Gone Girl, LOL. The conclusion to this novel is the most overused and uninspired “twist” you can ever imagine. What a way to ruin a perfectly OK novel.Thanks to Netgalley and Quercus Books for giving me the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.796905"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.796905"]]

He is a minimalist and is very choosy about who he will lease the house too.

Emma wants to find a safe place to live after being burglarized and attacked in her home. She is approved to live at the house and moves in with her boyfriend Simon. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is looking to find some kind of solace in the stark walls of the house. Both Jane and Emma bear a striking resemblance to each other and to Edwards late wife.

Was it really just an accident or were there other mitigating factors resulting in Emma’s death?There were some aspects of this book that I did not like but it was still an interesting concept .

I’d like to give it a 3 for some good writing but the story was just so utterly unbelievable and the characters so unlikable that I don’t want anyone to think that I would recommend this book. The author is obviously very talented so I’ll stick with the 3.The premise of the book sounded interesting, and it certainly had some rave reviews from other authors: “Dazzling, startling, and above all cunning—a pitch-perfect novel of psychological suspense.“—Lee ChildFor a thriller to be a real page turner and give me that “tingly, tense” feeling, I need to find it believable. The two main characters, Emma and then Jane are our narrators and the chapters alternate between the two voices. Emma has suffered a personal trauma and supposedly is the perfect type of woman who would be taken in by Edward and his incredibly constricting rules for renting a home that he built with many things computer controlled by someone called “housekeeper”. She has to fill out an application that is about 20 pages long and asks incredibly personal and downright stupid questions. Emma moves in, a victim of Edward’s sociopathic, narcissistic personality and has a relationship with him. Jane is our present day narrator, another woman who suffered a personal tragedy, Same rules, same manipulation, same relationship with the multi-flawed Edward. When she starts to investigate what happened to Emma, Edward becomes furious and cuts off his relationship with Jane. She,however, continues to investigate Emma’s death including befriending her previous boyfriend, Simon. Here enters another component to the puzzle of what really happened to Emma.I could not believe that anyone would want to rent a place that has so many manipulative rules and does not allow you not to bring in anything personal to change the appearance of the stark, minimalist environment. Why would you rent from someone who is so domineering and obviously manipulative?What really put me over the line on this book however was the (*spoiler alert) introduction of the subject of Down’s syndrome. I’m not sure why the author chose to bring up this very sensitive subject in the telling of a psychological thriller. I felt it was out of place and served no purpose. There was also way too much sexual detail in this book, more than I felt was necessary to tell the story. The Girl Before we find out is not really Emma, but I'll leave that to the readers to find out.I would not recommend this book but I’m sure there is an audience out there for it. I did finish it as I wanted to read the outcome but that also was disappointing to me.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher and NetGalley."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.821395"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.821395"]]

I remember reading a sample of this book, and being blown away by its fantastic opening, thinking I can’t wait to continue reading this book! After days of wondering what happened to Emma, how did she die, did the technology in the house kill her or was it the architect himself, does the same fate await Jane? – So many questions! As soon as the full book was made available to me, I dropped everything to finish it.It’s not easy to become a resident of One Folgate Street; first there’s a long list of rules to abide by, second there’s a lengthy application form – not many make it that far, but if you do, you have to past the interview stage of the application process. However, once you’re a tenant, you get to reside in an ultra-minimalist house run by tomorrow’s technology, designed by a world leading architect.Two narratives run side by side in this book – Then amp; Now. Then was Emma, the former tenant, who died under mysterious circumstances, while living there. Now – Jane, the current tenant. From the offset, we know that the two narratives were going to become entwined and I loved the clever way they did.Aimed at fans of Gone Girl, this book does have the unlikeable characters, yes, but other than that I believe this book should stand alone as when I was reading this book, I had no thoughts of any other book, I was so wrapped up in this story. You do start off liking both Emma and Jane, but as the story progresses, Delaney shows us the true characteristics of both these women, and let me tell you, I was not prepared for their deceitful, vindictive nature; at times, some of their actions literally made me cringe. As events unfolded, I was shocked and pulled deeper into the story as I had no idea what was to come; the alternating chapters between Emma and Jane made this book so addictive, each narrative left me wanting more, this book kept me turning pages at great speed.I don’t even know why I bother to guess how books end anymore, or who the guilty party is, as again, here, I made my prediction, and I was so far off the mark, I’m not even going to say anymore. Overall, this book is fast-paced, thrilling and thoroughly addictive, I highly recommend it and I’m sure you’ll fly through its suspenseful pages just as I did.*Thank you to the author (JP Delaney) and the publisher (Quercus) for granting me access to a digital copy of this book via Netgalley*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.824309"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.824309"]]

O leitor fica sempre em dúvida se ele é o herói, a vítima ou o vilão desta história e embora seja uma destas coisas, não consegui gostar desta personagem, com as suas obsessões um pouco bizarras.Quanto às duas protagonistas, gostei de ambas embora tenha gostado um pouco mais da Jane porque teve um pouco mais de coragem do que a Emma mas são duas personagens muito semelhantes, às vezes com as mesmas dúvidas e pensamentos, portanto se não tivesse atenção ao início do capítulo que indicava que ponto de vista se tratava, acabava por confundir ambas.Eu não li ainda muitos thrillers psicológicos mas tenho vindo a gostar de alguns muito bem falados no mercado mas este infelizmente não me convenceu. Li o livro em dois dias pelo tempo disponível e fácil leitura mas tirando o mistério à volt do Edward e do assassino, o livro não puxou muito pela minha cabeça, achei tudo muito mediano.Ainda assim para os amantes do género acho que é um livro que merecesse sem duvida uma leitura, não esperem muito e já agora se conseguirem não leiam a sinopse pois revela um spoiler do livro. http://algodaodoceparaocerebro.blogsp..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.844428"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.844428"]]

It's important to be able to form an independent opinion of a book despite hearing and reading the reviews of others. This is especially difficult when a book has been receiving sterling reviews, as this one has. But in this case, I need to go against the grain and say that this read just didn't do it for me.Despite this book getting off to a promising start, I found that it very soon became unrealistic and lacked substance. I found myself constantly asking \"why would anyone do that?\" or saying to myself \"that would never happen in real life.\" Without giving anything away, let me just say that I don't know of a single person that would agree to rent and live in a house in which they were not even allowed to put a coffee mug down, or to leave the book they are busy reading in the lounge. A house that required the lessee to sign a lease with more than 200 prohibitive conditions, where the lessee had to agree to random surveys about themselves and if not completed within a short time period, certain fundamental appliances in the house would not work, like the shower or the stove. That is all just too ridiculously far fetched for me. I also found Edward to be an unrealistic character and one that would not get very far in real life, let alone be absolutely adored by not one but two woman. I know we are talking about a fictional story here, but still, for me a story must always be believable or else you lose me. So, unfortunately I must conclude by saying that this one won't make it onto my favourites list for this year.

I don't actually have a do not recommend pile but I may have to make one for books such as this.This book follows the stories of two women (eerily similar women but more about that in a moment) who have the opportunity to move into One Folgate Street- a techno-minimalist state-of-the-art architectural masterpiece- at a discounted rent as long as they can abide by a strict set of rules. The chapters alternate between Emma (then) and Jane (now) who discovers that Emma mysteriously died in the apartment and is determined to find out what really happened to her. The story heavily centers around romance, but a twisted and unenjoyable one. After each woman moves in, they are immediately approached by Edward, the owner/architect, who tells them bluntly \"I want to go to bed with you.\" Both women have the same response which is \"Oh, how intriguing. Well, alright then.\" Not... how creepy I don't know you? No thoughts about the potential complications that could arise from sleeping with the notoriously neurotic owner of the building? Not to mention that as the women actually get to know Edward he clearly has some major control issues and so I just couldn't understand their attraction towards him. I'm already rolling my eyes, but then the relationship spirals into a dominating, controlling, obsessive mess that became seriously cringeworthy.I considered DNFing at this point- and I never DNF- but told myself maybe it would be twisty and turny enough to redeem itself and I pressed onward.

Having been a victim of an armed robbery she no longer feels safe in the flat she shares with her boyfriend Simon. Convinced a new house would help with her new start Emma amp; Simon go house hunting but nothing in their price range seems right or, more importantly, safe enough. That is until they visit One Colgate street, a beautiful minimalist house designed by the mysterious (and handsome) Edward Monkton. The only problem iis that to live there you have to agree tiotio follow 200 very strict and bizarre rules, fill in a lengthy questionnaire anbd be interviewed by the architect himself. Despite all this, and her boyfriend's reservations, Emma iis determined to live there. She is therefore thrilled when their application gets approved as she is sure the house will help make her a better person and help aid her recovery from the roibbery. Now: Jane us another lady who really wants to leave her past behind her with a move to a new house. Having recently suffered a still birth Jane can't bear to stay in the house she expected to brinbg her baby daughter home to. Like Emma, she immediately falls in love with One Folgate Street and is convinced that iit will be the new start she needs. Whilst meeting with the architect she finds herself a little attracted to him, so when flowers start arriving she flatters herself thinking they are from him. However a chance meeting with the man leaving the flowers leads to her discovering they are meant for Emma, the lady that used to live there and sadly died in the house. The man leaves before Jane can discover moire leaving her confused and a little uneasy. I've unfortunately had to stop reading this book as I was finding Jane's story quite upsetting. I lost my son, Christopher, at 24 weeks and Jane's experiences were too like my own and bought back a load of really bad memories. I don't know if the author has experienced something similar but it his description bought a lump to my throat, particularly the attitude of the hospital to it all. There were parts of the book I was enjoying up to that part. The dual story line was interesting and the lives of Emma and Jane echoing each other helped to build the tension and made for a interesting read. I wasn't too sure where the story was going as it seemed to deviate off into fifty shades of gray territory at times which was a little confusing. Despite her story being a hard read I liked Jane as a character and found her to be quite sensible. I also understood her more as I knew exactly how she was feeling. I wasn't so sure I liked Emma as she seemed a little silly and out of control and I found her a little annoying to be honest. This book has had a lot of great reviews and hype on social media and I would encourage anyone to read it for themselves and make up their own minds. If you have suffered the loss of a child I would say you should avoid this book as it does make for painful reading. Thank you to Quercus publishers for giving me a copy of this boom to review. I'm glad I tried it as I would have always wondered about it but it was just ok hard for me to finish. I wish there had been a warning regarding the child loss story as I wouldn't have read it."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.878564"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.878564"]]

The Girl Before, really is a book that grips you, it is compelling, breath-taking and has more twists than twister. This is a book that really will tick all the boxes for fans of the psychological thriller, there is the mystery, the intrigue, the changes of pace and twists that you cannot predict to where and when, and like a magician JP Delaney is not afraid to use the sleight of hand.This is thriller is two stories that become one around One Folgate Street, a perfect house for some, with a set of rules for all tenants that are constantly assessed by the technology around the house. The house is designed to be perfect, to some austere to others an architectural dream and to all residents an experiment in a new way of life, for the better.Edward Monkford designed One Folgate Street after the death of his wife and child and it is in a way a monument to them as well as pushing the boundaries of design. The house is not for everyone is it is very minimalistic mixed with cutting edge technology, its own housekeeping system that manages everything within the house, including the tenant. Before a tenant can move in they have to sign a legal document to show that they will not break any of the 200 rules that are in place to manage the house.The story is split in two, between Emma (Then), and Jane (Now) and how they both lived within One Folgate Street and its rules. We also discover the tragic reasons that both are happy to do away with many of their personal possessions to live a new austere life, which Edward Monkford observes and manages for them.Emma and Jane are two totally different people and we see their stories unfold separately but at the same time see how Monkford influences both their lives. Both have been through traumatic events in the life and are looking for change, the stories are told in both the past and present tense which helps to draw you in. At the same time, all the chapters are separated by various psychoanalytic questions the sort that are taken during a psychometric test so there is no right or wrong answer.Throughout the book, we see that both Emma and Jane have obsessions that seem to take over everything that they are doing. Jane’s obsession is Emma and how she lived and died within the house and whether there was any foul play in her death. Jane’s obsession of Emma is destructive in part especially when she feels like the house is spying on her.This book is punchy and will easily become a bestseller and it is understandable why this has already been optioned for film production.

This book is on lists everywhere as one of this years \"it\" books for thrillers. I enjoyed the book, but I also had some problems with it. My husband is an architect so I could relate to much of the details in the story that were architectural and I appreciated that research went into those parts of the story to make it more authentic to the character. I liked the way that the story was told in alternating chapters between our two main female narrators. I thought it was very interesting and creative how the author would tell the stories that were parallel and different at the same time, without confusing the reader. The story itself was interesting and there were little easter eggs throughout the story that helped you figure out who the killer was. However you didn't really arrive at that until about 15% left in the book, although you may have suspicions you are never really quite sure who \"done it.\" I also liked that there were multiple references to Breakfast At Tiffany's through the book, as that is one of my favorite movies. I found the story to be engaging and interesting. I did get to points where I did not want to put it down.There were only a few things that were off putting. The biggest was the author's overused phrase \"he/she goes\" when explaining about another characters talking to the narrator. Now, I read an unfinished copy so that could very well be edited out by the time this hits shelves. Another thing that bothered me is that when you get to about 50% the book suffers from a lot of repetitiveness. It seems that we keep hearing the same thing over and over for some time before the story finally starts moving forward again. That slowed the book down considerably for me. To me it didn't seem that there was a purpose for the story to keep repeating the same information continuously. However, once it started moving again, the story gripped you until the very end. Overall I did enjoy the story and would read more by this author.

Read it in two days.I won this book from the Goodreads giveaway program - an advance reader's edition - and am quite glad I did. I didn't know what to expect, but this was one great read.Told from the POV of two alternating MC's, both young women, in present tense. However, one woman, Emma, is labeled as 'Then,' and the other, Jane, is labeled 'Now.' This makes the story unfold in a rather linear fashion, even though Emma's story is happening prior to Jane's.Confused? Not if you're reading the book. Both women, at different times, elect to live in a highly technologically 'advanced' house designed by an enigmatic and exacting architect. There are a hundred 'rules' to follow in order to live in the house, including no rugs, no books, no pets, and so on, but the house is almost a living thing, digitally wired/enhanced in such a way as to eliminate most 'clutter' and complexity from life. It's clean living elevated to the nth degree, without doors, with all clean lines, smooth surfaces, and just the barest necessities provided. It's warm and clean and safe, and if you hate clutter, you'd love this house.(Myself, I like a little clutter.)Anyhow, both young women are coming from a difficult place - a burglary and possible sexual assault for one, a terrible miscarriage for the other. The opportunity to 'start fresh' and live in such an architectural wonder is appealing to both, but with different outcomes. The way their lives intersect, and what happens when one, then the other get involved with the architect who designed the house, leads to a murder mystery, and revelations that are equally surprising.It was an intriguing read and I've heard that a movie may be in the offing, directed by Ron Howard. Regardless if true or not, I highly recommend this to suspense/thriller/mystery readers.Five stars.

Das Cover und der Titel haben sofort meine Aufmerksamkeit erregt, obwohl ich langsam etwas durcheinander komme mit all den Bücher, die irgendwas mit 'Girl' im Titel tragen. Andererseits ist der Buchtitel durchaus passend für die Geschichte.In der Geschichte begleiten wir Jane, die uns durch die gegenwärtige Zeit führt und Emma, die wir in Rückblicken kennen lernen. Jane hat einen schweren Schicksalsschlag hinter sich und hat nun die Chance auf einen Neuanfang in einem technisch hochmodernen Haus. Das Haus ist sehr speziell und stellt gewissermaßen Ansprüche an seine Bewohner - es verfügt kaum über Möbel, strahlt allgemein keine Gemütlichkeit aus und alles funktioniert digital. Als Jane erfährt, dass ihre Vormieterin, Emma, im Haus gestorben ist, fängt sie an zu recherchieren und deckt so ungeahnte Dinge auf.Durch den Wechsel der Perspektiven lernen wir beide Figuren sehr gut kennen. Allerdings sind sich die beiden nicht unähnlich, es dreht sich oft um ähnliche Begebenheiten, so dass ich manchmal mitten im Kapitel zurückblättern musste, weil unklar war, aus welcher Perspektive ich gerade lese. Beide Frauen haben recht naiv und gutgläubig gehandelt, was mich manchmal schon etwas aufgeregt hat. Wie oft kann man bitte das Schrillen sämtlicher Alarmglocken überhören? Und warum kamen den Damen teilweise erst Monde später Gedanken, die quasi auf der Hand lagen? Nichtsdestotrotz haben mir beide Perspektiven insofern gefallen, dass ich das Buch kaum weglegen konnte. Der sogenannte 'charismatische' Besitzer und Architekt des Hauses war mir jedoch die unerträglichste Person des Buches. Edward wies so viele Parallelen zu typischen männlichen Hauptfiguren in New Adult Romanen auf, dass ich nicht umhin kam, ihn als eine Art 'Psycho-Mr.Grey' zu sehen.Trotz der gewöhnungsbedürftigen Figuren, habe ich die Geschichte in kurzer Zeit durchgelesen. Anfangs war mein Lesefluss etwas gestört von der Tatsache, dass in den Rückblenden die wörtliche Rede nicht gekennzeichnet war, daran habe ich mich aber schnell gewöhnt.Im Verlauf gab es einige Überraschungen und auch das Ende gehörte für mich nicht unbedingt zu den vorhersehbarsten. Alles in allem fand ich das Buch durchaus überzeugend. Übrigens ist auch schon eine Verfilmung geplant, die ich mir dann gerne anschauen würde.*Rezensionsexemplar"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.904234"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.904234"]]

Debo decir que al libro le cuesta un poco arrancar y tarda demasiado en centrar la historia, por tanto si os decidís a leerlo, no tiréis la toalla a la primera de cambio porque a partir de la página 100 se pone más interesante y empiezan a suceder bastantes cosas. Tengo sensaciones muy encontradas respecto a este libro. En ocasiones lo encontraba un poco plano pero el final me convenció bastante y le dio sentido a todo. Pero a pesar de ser un thriller, creo que es uno de esos libros que necesitan reposar unos días para reflexionar sobre él. Para que os hagáis una idea, sería el resultado de meter en una batidora a: \"La magia del orden\" de Marie Kondo, \"50 sombras de Grey\" y un thriller de moda como podría ser \"La chica del tren\" o \"El método 15/33\" de Shannon Kirk.Los personajes son bastante oscuros y todos tienen mucho que ocultar, es complicado saber cuánto hay de cierto en las palabras de cada uno. Las víctimas se vuelven verdugos, y viceversa, en un abrir y cerrar de ojos.Os preguntaréis si era predecible, pero normalmente procuro dejarme llevar por la historia sin pensar más allá y, en este caso, como lo leí prácticamente en el mismo día, tampoco tuve mucho tiempo para armarme mis teorías. Muchas veces hay que meterse en las historias sin intentar adivinar lo que está pasando y dejar que la historia sea la que te sorprenda.En resumen: si os gustan los thrillers es una lectura obligatoria.

The presentation of the story definitely hooked me as there were two narrators and two timelines. That said, both women bore striking resemblances to one another in appearances and experiences. This strengthened my belief that it was a plot I'd already read. Then things started to change shape. None of the characters are particularly likeable but the narrators also turn out to be somewhat unreliable which I found intriguing as I looked at the way information was cleverly presented to the reader to lead the thought process off direction without the narrator changing the story within her own head. The sex is a little too salacious for my taste yet details were sparse, innuendo doing the most work. Besides the sex, the book offered a compelling thriller with story twists I didn't see coming, red herrings planted just so, then discredited, then questioned, then new possibilities arise...Solid thriller.

Delaney's THE GIRL BEFORE has such an alluring premise and there moments where I couldn't put it down. But the far-fetched plot points, pseudo-sexual dominant storyline, and over-abundance of twists and turns left me feeling less than enthused about the novel overall.The story follows Emma and Jane, two women separated by time. In the past, Emma, who is still suffering the effects of a recent home invasion, moves into One Folgate Street with her adoring boyfriend. In the present, Jane is recovering from the loss of her child and hoping to start anew in the house. Designed by renowned minimalist architect, Edward Monkford, One Folgate Street is well-known in the London renter's market. But its occupants—the ones who get through vigorous application process—must abide by an exhaustive list of terms and conditions. Jane becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Emma, the girl before her. But the closer she gets to the truth, trouble follows her putting her life in danger. Is Edward a psychopath desperate for control? Or is there something else going on?On one hand, I reached a point in THE GIRL BEFORE (albeit late in the novel) and I absolutely couldn't put it down. Like Jane, I was desperate to find out Emma's truth. What exactly happened to her? Why was Jane's experiences in the house almost identical to Emma's?But what I wasn't expecting was to be given a dark sexual storyline (just FYI—it's not a romance), that came out of nowhere. It was bizarre. That aspect of the book really threw me for a loop and it wasn't something I enjoyed at all, especially all the \"Yes, Daddy\" talk.I liked the duplicitous characterization that played out in the novel. That led to some interesting revelations for the reader. The transitions between the alternating points of view was seamless, but sometimes due to the characters' almost parallel storylines it was confusing at times to distinguish the two women's story arcs.\n  There was a time when One Folgate Street seemed like a calm, serene haven. Now it doesn't. It feels claustrophobic and mean. Like the house is angry with me.\nEmma's chapters are written without quotation marks, something that was a deliberate choice of style. Though, I'm not sure what it was meant to accomplish. A form of minimalism? To emphasize that she no longer had a voice in the present time? This took some time getting used to and it made it a little more difficult to read. Had I completely understood this writing style choice, maybe I could be more forgiving, but it didn't really make sense to me. The ending felt really rush and, if I'm honest, contrived where Jane was concerned.. We're given almost no resolution with Edward's character, which was disappointing to me.I can definitely see the commercial appeal of this novel and hence, why there is a movie deal. It's a blend of a dark sexual thriller and a whodunit with suspects and motives in every direction. But several plot points didn't work for me and didn't enjoy the book as a whole.*  Thanks to Ballantine Books for the chance to read an early copy.

This book tells the story of Emma before and Jane Now. Both women who have had traumatic things happen to them in their lives and through a long application process are able to rent One Folgate Street. A home built by an eccentric architect who suffered the loss of his wife and son. The home is very stark and occupants must abide by a very long rental agreement.EmmaEmma moves into One Folgate Street with her boyfriend, Simon, after a break in at their home. Soon things start to change and Emma begins a relationship with the strange, handsome architect.JaneJane moves into One Folgate Street after a traumatic loss. She finds the home to be interesting but not as interesting as the architect and the story of the loss of his wife and his relationship with it's former occupant, Emma.I loved how the chapters flipped back and forth between the two women's stories. This made the book a very fast read. Things never got dull. There really is not down time in this book. No long descriptions, no wordy prose. It was actually quite nice to read a bit about one woman in the past and then read about the other woman in the future. Sometimes when books have multiple POW's being told it gets tedious. Not in this book. This is this books strong point IMO. Though going back and forth in time and reading each woman's POW, it soon becomes apparent that the two women are tied together somehow. Even the house itself is like a character in the book as it is built to learn about them and to help make them \"better\".Not everyone is as they seem in this book. I really loved that aspect. Who is telling the truth? Who is the wolf in sheep's clothing? What really happens? Who can we trust? I really enjoyed the twists and turns. This was a very fast read. Very enjoyable and well thought out. Is it the best book I have ever read? No, certainly not but it is a very enjoyable book. Sometimes it is just a pleasure to sit and read a book that grabs one's attention, is entertaining and makes one think.

For one of the first times, I decided to look at reviews before I read. I’m not sure why there are comparisons to Gone Girl or the Girl on the Train beyond the titles, though there is a similar tone in voice to Girl on the Train. That aside, I do think Gone Girl and Girl on the Train were stronger in suspense and tension and also in dealing with psycholical aspects of their characters. But I'm no psychologist so who knows.The setting, a house, in this story is as much a character as the two protagonists, Emma and Jane. They both come and live in One Folgate Street — a perfect and beautiful ultra-minimalist house designed by an obsessive and enigmatic architect named Edward. The house can sense their moods, changes lightning, trace their steps through the house, and monitor everything from the tenants weight, items in the fridge in the cupboard and a host of things that would take a special tenant to cope with. It also has a state of the art security system.Emma, we learn from the blurb, has died in the house after living there for a period with her boyfriend. When Jane comes to live there a few years after Emma’s death it’s hard not to wonder how Emma really died and if Jane will suffer the same fate. I did decide that I knew who the antagonist was very early. This was a little disappointing, and there was a moment two thirds of the way through, where I became very weary of Emma’s constant change of story and at one point it became completely illogical to me --- but that moment passed to some degree, and when it was made clear who the antagonist was, I had that sense of dread till near the ending."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.952376"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.952376"]]

After the deaths of his wife and child, Monkford starts leasing out the house, but he is very particular about the tenants. They all seem to be female and they all must agree to an elaborate set of conditions in the lease. The book is told in alternating chapters by two tenants, Emma (the girl before) and Jane. My initial problem with the book was that Emma and Jane aren't girls. They are grown-ass women who should not be so stupid..the whole premise of the book is ridiculous. Unless you have been homeless and living on the streets for six months you would not be desperate enough to sign a lease with 200 conditions with respect to which you will be punished if you do not comply Your mandatory cleaning service is required to spy on you and report infractions to the landlord. And for this you get to live in a house that would make an egg look over decorated. Also sex with Monkford seems to be an unwritten part of the deal (not that either Emma or Jane showed the slightest reluctance). I should know better than to try to read books with \"girl\" in the title. A lot of sex and two incredibly stupid women - this book was definitely not for me.

I received a gorgeous copy of The Girl Before when I was at Harrogate last year, it’s totally white apart from the orange edged pages and the title and authors name are embossed on the cover. But even if I thought that the visual appearance of my copy was stunning it didn’t prepare me for the perfectly pitched plot on the inside. Goodness me I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK! I may even keep it beside me for a little bit longer-I’m not quite sure I’m ready to let it go just yet!Everything about this book worked for me, apart from one little thing and I’ll come to that later! I loved the dual plot thread of Emma (Then) and Jane (Now). Emma’s story felt almost theatrical, and with no speech marks in her chapters there was also a more voyeuristic feeling. That, combined with the sense of creepiness that builds gradually, made me feel as though we were also part of the “housekeeping”in the home that separates the two women by three years. I felt more of a connection to Jane from the very start and have to say that I felt her experiences were handled in a very compassionate and perceptive manner. She was my perfect heroine, intelligent, fearless and strong minded but never easily interpreted.This was a perfect “read in one addictive session” book as I was desperate to find out what secrets the house at One Folgate Street was hiding. Watching the dual stories of Emma and Jane come crashing together was utterly compelling. The one teeny tiny little fly in the ointment for me was Edward, a character that I found to be a little too “Christian Grey” at times, more of a caricature than I would have liked but weirdly enough, he did work within this whole concept of control that ran through the narrative. I couldn’t imagine either of the women falling so deeply under his spell, there was little charisma there for me but each to their own I suppose!  Just don’t get me started on the list of questions that sat in judgement at the start of each chapter! My moral compass definitely found them to be a little more challenging than I would have liked and they certainly caused some rather heated debates within this household!I’ve read that Ron Howard is going to be directing the film version of this book. Now, I have a great respect for him as a director so he had better do this book justice! I’m particularly worried about comparisons with The Girl on The Train as I really didn’t find that film version sympathetic to the book. I do hope that they don’t make the same error here in relocating the setting to New York. Or similar. One of the things I loved about this book was the whole architectural concept, the house at One Folgate Street and the city of London, incorporating the museums, which all seemed so quintessentially British to me so I will be keeping everything crossed!This dark and sometimes disturbing book is proving to be a bit of a Marmite read, having now looked at what other reviewers are saying. It surprised me by surpassing my expectations so I’m sticking my head above the parapet and saying I LOVED IT! So, J P Delaney, whoever you are, I’d like more of the same please!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.975024"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.975024"]]

I enjoyed every page of this thriller.The story is narrated by the two main characters Emma and Jane in a typical Now amp; Then style (where Emma is “then” and Jane is “now”). So, both girls are looking for a new place to move in. Each one suffering some personal trauma and seeking a new start in a new home. After a lot of search, each in her own time finally reaches One Folgate Street, which is beyond perfect. It’s very calming with perfect design. A masterpiece. A dream comes true. However, the owner has terms. Very strict rules actually. As bizarre as this seems, each girl, desperate to be the tenant of this masterpiece, approves to the terms and gets into the process of the application and interview hoping to be the lucky accepted tenant. And what a happy surprise for each to be asked to an interview with the owner and then accepted as the new tenant.Jane is attracted to the handsome seductive owner at once. He is too. And thus, their relation starts. But Jane has her doubts when she knows about the previous tenant and the mysterious crime. As she searches for the truth, she takes the reader with her in a roller coaster of twists and turns where nothing is what it seems to be. I loved this roller coaster a lot. I tried to be the smart girl all along and guess what’s next. Whenever I thought “That’s it. Got you!!” I found my guessing to be wrong. Ha! I always love the double narration and the now and then style. I was caught in and desperate to know what’s next.The handsome seductive owner of One Folgate Street is another issue. He is dark, mysterious yet you can’t help but love him. This is one of the few times when you just like the supposedly villain of the novel. Just like in “Jane Eyre”, or was I the only one who loved Rochester?I also loved the End. I will not be the silly girl who spoils it for you. I will only say that I liked it.The audiobook was also great. I loved listening to it going back and forth between the audiobook and the eBook.Finally, for those who enjoy psychological thrillers, you should read The Girl Before. I highly recommend it.** Special thanks to NetGalley amp; Ballantine Books for supplying my copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review **For all my reviews please visit http://www.meshascorner.net"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.978513"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.978513"]]

Its tormented twistiness tugs at the fraying strings of the characters as they live in the shadow of a peculiar architect’s unconventional vision of perfection.Two distinctive, yet interchangeable, time periods, “then: Emma” and “now: Jane”, begin to reveal the secrets of One Folgate Street. The property itself is quite extraordinary, but so are the uncompromising terms which must be obeyed in accordance to a restricted covenant detailing specific demands of anyone who is granted permission to live there.Emma and her boyfriend Simon, the previous tenants, were at the centre of a break in at their previous home. Emma needs to feel safer and the hi-tec security of this new property offered that, it’s just the rest of their lives that needed fixing. Jane, the current tenant, suffered a stillbirth. She’s grieving and is striving to start again. A clean slate she what she needs, with nothing holding her back just a genuine desire to be content, process her loss, and try to curb her curiosity about the death of The Girl Before.Is it possible for any tenant, no matter how meticulous the selection process, to live up the high standards of such a minimalistic environment, bordering on an impossible regime? Even after jumping through hoops, can they truly reap the full benefits of living in this pristine, clutter free, and questionably affordable property?Well, we soon discover the answer to that question as we meet the key characters desperate to change their lives when completing a curious questionnaire, which initially tests their integrity for selection to their first interview. However, the psychoanalysis continues while they live at One Folgate Street, assessing their quality of life and whether it has improved since becoming a resident.The reasoning behind the odd rules and why these particular individuals were selected is drip fed into their blurring stories. It’s as though the architect’s desire for perfection for the building and the tenant becomes inseparable. The inflexible, obsessive, supremacy of Edward Monkton knows exactly how he wants his plans to perform and there are certain parts of his tenants’ lives that are surplus to requirements.The psychological drama rattles unremittingly until its toxic snake bite of an ending. For a simple catalyst of property hunting to ignite such a perfect spark of intrigue is just pure genius.

After a personal tragedy takes a hold in her life, Jane decides to make a few changes. She leaves her job for another and decides to also leave her home, beginning her search for somewhere better. Upon house hunting, a real estate agent offers her a look into One Folgate Street, where the demands of the house are quite odd, but the house itself made architecturally stunning. Jane takes up the offer on the house and soon finds that there's something eery about a place that's too perfect.

There have been so many \"girl\" books as of late, that sort of always have the same plot and not much of just being thrilling.However, once I began reading, I had a feeling this one was it for me despite not being able to pick up a thriller for quite some time.Immediately, I was hooked. This story was fast-paced and intriguing, so much so that I found myself up late at night unable to put it down, for fear of not being able to catch up and find out all of the answers. I enjoyed the story being told in Emma's (then) and Jane's (now) point of view. I did not find myself getting confused, even though throughout the book you find parallels between the two women and their lives. Though these women are both so different, you can see what similar decisions they make that lead them to ultimately begin living the same life.The writing and the characters were it for me. At times there was such dark writing as we get to see more of Jane's and Emma's history and what has brought them to One Folgate Street, and then we see this vivid writing with details of architectural work and character descriptions.I even became slightly interested in architecture along the way, so props to that! I very much enjoyed Jane, more than Emma, and found myself rooting for her towards finding answers and getting herself out of fate's way. She has this strong independence in her that you don't see in Emma, or in any other character, that I loved.Overall, I had a really great reading experience and I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a thrill. The writing, the characters, the mood will get you hooked and even you'll find yourself marveling at the odd wonder of One Folgate Street."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.992285"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.992285"]]

However, found it a bit impossible to believe at some points, sounded like a TV drama more than a thriller. I found myself thinking - really? People cant possibly be that stupid, right? Or I am just naive. So yes, I found one of the main characters annoying. Very annoying, she just could not decide what kind of person she is, and that melodramatic jumping from being broken victim to strong crazy sexy woman was ridiculous.

Delaney estreia-se no mundo editorial com A Rapariga de Antes, um thriller psicológico que tem tido bastante aceitação da parte dos leitores, após a sua publicação no início deste ano. Na realidade, trata-te de um pseudónimo do autor inglês Tony Strong, que para além de publicar com o seu nome, tem vários livros editados com o pseudónimo Anthony Capella (também publicado em Portugal).Por causa do hype em redor deste lançamento e porque recentemente este género me tem revelado boas surpresas, a minha curiosidade ficou bastante aguçada e foi com avidez que iniciei esta leitura. A narrativa alterna capítulos sob o ponto de vista de duas mulheres, Emma no passado e Jane no presente, enquanto o leitor vai acompanhando a ida de ambas para o n.º 1 Folgate Street, uma casa londrina bastante sui generis e que desde o início do livro parece tanto uma personagem real como as duas mulheres.Esta casa é uma criação única do afamado arquiteto Edward Monkford, que só permite que alguém lá resida se cumprir uma série de requisitos e se comprometer a seguir várias regras para lá morar. Tanto Emma como Jane passam no teste e acabam por se envolver com Edward, assumindo a história um paralelismo afetado pelo ambiente peculiar da casa. Jane acaba por saber que a anterior inquilina, Emma, morreu dentro da casa em condições algo estranhas e decide investigar o passado de Emma, o que a leva a caminhos sinuosos e cheios de revelações.A Rapariga de Antes é um livro que fala de obsessões. A mais evidente é a obsessão pelo minimalismo da parte de Edward, fruto do seu transtorno obsessivo-compulsivo. A casa é um reflexo dessa sua faceta, aqui levada ao extremo não só pelas várias exigências que faz aos seus inquilinos, mas também pela tecnologia presente, que parece esconder sob a capa da inovação e modernismo a invasão da privacidade dos seus moradores. Mas também há personagens com obsessão pela mentira, por uma pessoa em particular ou por determinadas práticas sexuais.Foi um livro que li num ápice, curiosa por saber o que, afinal de contas, tinha acontecido a Emma. Gostei bastante do início do livro, em especial pelo ambiente algo sinistro que o autor consegue criar, mas pareceu-me que a difícil tarefa de o manter ao longo de todo o livro acabou por não ser completamente bem sucedida. No final de contas, é um thriller psicológico interessante, com boas ideias e que, apesar de não ser perfeito, proporcionou boas horas de leitura."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.047052"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.047052"]]

The Girl Before is a fascinatingly frustrating read wherein the narrative is so much more clever and compelling than any of its characters, particularly the main two heroines, the girl before, Emma, and the girl after, Jane. Those two are just...insipid, infuriating, maddening. The book itself is essentially Fifty Shades of Grey with architecture. Both Emma and Jane in their respective timelines, which are precision interweaved throughout the story, occasionally dizzyingly so, fall for an obsessive compulsive domineering architect with Samp;M tendencies, Edward, after coming to live in his showcase of a house. Appropriately both the house and its creator have all the charm and warmth of a particularly ascetic modern design, you know the sort with limited number of uncomfortable overpriced furniture and slick austere nothingness. Yeah, that, apparently irresistible to a certain type of women, someone's who's undergone a recent tragedy, for example. And so the games begin...while Edward can't be entirely trusted, neither can as it turns out anyone. Delaney muddies the waters with unreliable narrators and suspense, so you just have to find out what's going on, and to her credit she does create a dynamic fun sort of a thriller, almost in spite of her oversexed imbecile characters. And so as entertaining as it was, the estrogen just overwhelmed it much too much for it to be genuinely good. Maybe I'm not its typical target audience. This was quite possibly meant for those who thought Fifty Shades of Grey needed some suspense and a murder or two. Maybe I shouldn't be referring to the book I haven't actually read, but I know the gist, doesn't everyone by now. At any rate shame to see an obviously talented author limiting herself to a trend, trends are stupid for the most part anyway, but surely money talks and all that.

One has shadowy parents, neither has siblings, and they are neatly set adrift with minimal back story in north west London, where we all know that the rents are high and the people unfriendly, apart from the single chatty neighbour.The architectural context could have been interesting but it was confined to some superficial descriptions of buildings (all of which involved \"pale stone\": could have done with some editing, I think) and lists of names of famous architects. A smattering of medical jargon was thrown in for good measure.As for the plot, the true villain was obvious to me from the earliest pages.

I absolutely could not put this book down and finished it in three days instead of one only because I had to go to work.The story is based around a house located at One Folgate Street. There are two women who apply to live in the house and the story is told from their points of view from the time they apply to the time they leave the house. In order to live in the house, applicants must agree to a long list of rules that were created by the builder who originally built the house to live in with his now deceased wife and son. Emma, lives in the house first with her boyfriend Simon. Then several years later, Jane lives in the house. The fact that the two women look alike and also look like the builder’s deceased wife with dark hair and blue eyes is slightly unsettling. I really enjoyed reading this book because the characters came to life through the author’s writing. I could imagine the open floor plan of the house and each room from the kitchen (they called it something else in the book) to the bathroom with the sensor-activated shower head to the hidden panel that lead to the mop and broom closet. The answer seems so obvious to what happened to Emma, so of course, I knew there had to be a plot twist.

An architecturally interesting house is yours for an incredibly low rent if you answer pages of personal questions, agree to live by an enormous number of rules, and somehow please the architect.

Juxtaposing the lives and experiences of these two different women inside of the same house at different times was fascinating. A peek into the suspicious death of the architect's wife and child added to the intrigue. And now the negatives: at the half way point suddenly the story seemed trite. Edward the architect suddenly starts sounding like Christian Grey (of 50 Shades fame). A psychotherapist willingly shares notes from Emma's sessions with Jane.

Yes, it’s an above average psychological thriller, just barely. It’s a story of two women who have previously been traumatized and want/need to move to begin anew. The story is told in alternating chapters of both characters. These ladies are drawn to this austere building that requires the completion of a complex multiple-choice questionnaire, along with pictures. In addition, there is an in-depth, multipage contract that the occupant must agree to and sign. Along with the telling of the story, the reader learns of some of the questions. The house has a history of occupants suffering traumas (aka deaths) while living in the house. As a reader, one wonders who in their right mind would go through the dog and pony show, agree to the contract, and move in. Through the description provided, the house didn’t sound that fabulous to agree to such crazy stipulations. Author JP Delaney does scrape up a thriller in the question of how previous women met their demise and who was responsible for the downfall.Nonetheless, this reader finished it. As absurd as it sounds, there is a true thriller aspect to it, if you mindlessly go along with the basic foundation. Do I recommend it? Not really. There are far better thrillers out there.

I’m still glad I ended up reading it, but it definitely wasn’t as good as I was expecting, and ended up being more of a fence sitter.The story is told through alternating POV. The newest resident of One Folgate Street, Jane, and the girl before, Emma. We know right from the get go something had to have happened, obviously, because One Folgate Street is back on the market and not still being lived in by Emma. I found the premise of the house itself to be more intriguing than the lives of the women and the people in their lives. Hell, I wanted to move into One Folgate Street after reading the descriptions of the location and how the house itself was set up.This is tagged as mystery/thriller/suspense, and really all of that revolves around Jane trying to figure out what happened to Emma. The author really tries to make the reader suspect one person right from the get-go, but I’ve read too many mysteries to fall for it, and gradually came to the conclusion myself who the perp was before it was revealed.Overall, when I finished the story I was left with the thought that you really never know anyone 100%, and Every. Single. Person. has secrets. Ever person in this story has had something traumatic happen to them:-Emma: House was broken into and she no longer feels safe.-Jane: Had a personal tragedy regarding a pregnancy.-The Architect: Lost his wife and child years before in an architecture related accident.But when it really came down to it, I kinda felt like the architect was the only one that was sort of coping with what happened to them, and trying to move on. Emma and Jane always came off to me like they were just trying to fill a void in their lives, rather than accepting the fact that you can’t fill the voids that struggles have left you with. Square peg, round hole. A thing can never be broken or cracked and be remade to be exactly what it was before.I would recommend this book to those who don’t have strong background in reading mystery. I think those readers are the ones that would enjoy this the most. I guess I’m just too jaded so everything was really obvious to me. Still really happy I read this, finally, and would most likely look into something else from this author.Copy received through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.110813"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.110813"]]

I had heard such good things about it and I honestly didn't want to be disappointed. Too much hype surrounding a book release often leads to let down in my literary experience. I’m happy to say, this book was well worth all the buzz and more! However, now I need to try to sum up my reading experience without ruining it for anyone else….hmmmmm. Here I go!The Girl Before alternated seamlessly chapter by chapter between its two main characters, Emma and Jane. The story was told both in the present day with Jane and in the past with Emma. Both women were reeling from personal tragedy and searching for big changes in their lives. Jane was looking for a new place to live after suffering through the stillbirth of her first child. Emma had experienced a home invasion and was held at knife point. The exact events that occurred during the attack have been blurred by trauma. She wanted to remember the attack, but also forget at the same time.At the different times in the book, both of the women were shown the same home...the spectacular minimalistic house - One Folgate Street. The house was extraordinary. The house was the winner of architectural awards, its design was simple and sleek. But this house had a violent history and a determined, unwavering owner, Edward Monkford. Edward had a reputation of being a handful to deal with. The application process, the rules, and the way of life that the Edward demanded of you to live in this house, would have made the average person run away screaming. But not these two, they were blinded by the house's beauty and the idea of a simplistic lifestyle allured their senses.The twisting tale of these women and their experiences with the house and Edward kept me up at night, and reading until the wee hours of the morning. In my personal down times, I found myself contemplating where the plot was heading, and who was the true villain in the story? I changed my mind over and over. If you were to ask me, that's the true sign of great storytelling! That and the fact that I feel like I can't put all my thoughts on this one into this one review. It would be a disservice to how good this book was!Now, with that being said I don't think this book is for every reader - as most aren’t. I think people who enjoy mystery and thrillers will like it. The people who like to identify with the characters in the book may not. I personally didn't really like any of the characters. Jane was probably the most likeable for me. Edward was a big double thumbs down, a real turn off for me! I don't care how good looking and powerful you are or pretend to be, no one is going to tell me how to live! End of story!

Emma has just experienced a traumatic break in at her flat and is looking for a new place to live, but can’t seem to find something that is both affordable and feels safe to her. Until she looks at One Folate Street. The house is a minimalist design made of pale stone, high ceilings, plate glass and a very open floor plan and is considered to be an architectural masterpiece.But the enigmatic architect who designed the house has over 200 rules for living there, including no books, no photos, no clutter, no throw pillows or other personal effects as the house is meant to transform it’s occupant. Jane has just suffered a personal tragedy and is looking for a fresh start, which she believes she has found at One Folate Street. The space seems to bring her a sense of calm that she hasn’t felt in a while and she also feels drawn to the architect who created it. Shortly after moving in, Jane learns about the death of the home’s previous tenant; a woman who has a similar appearance to her. As Jane begins to investigate what happened, she has to untangle the truth from all the lies. She unknowingly begins to the follow the same patterns, make the same choices and cross paths with the same people and also begins to experience the same terror, as the girl before.I received an ARC of The Girl Before about 3 months ago and I so wish I had read it sooner because I absolutely loved it. It was not at all what I expected it to be. The story, as mentioned above, is told from two perspectives; Then: Emma and Now:Jane. So the perspectives switch every other chapter but it was very easy to follow alone. Also, in between most chapters is a question from the application package when the girls applied to One Folate Street and from the follow up surveys the girls filled out while living there. I also thought that was a nice touch and some of the questions did make me stop and think for a moment. I don’t want to give too much of the plot away but I do want to mention a few things. I really liked the author’s writing style and I felt that even though we split time between Emma and Jane, we got to know their characters pretty well. The architect, Edward, is also a very interesting character. This was one of those books that I could not stop reading because every time I thought I had the plot twists figured out, it would go in a different direction. I read almost the whole book in one day. It really captivated my attention. I can honestly say most of the plot twists I didn’t figure out until they happened and the author did a really good job with that. And the ending was also pretty good, not as dramatic as I had expected it to be, but unexpected. There is some sex in this book, which I like to mention when it’s a book that I normally wouldn’t expect to contain detailed sexual encounters. The scenes are all well done and it is nothing over the top. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.Thank you to the publisher for sending me an advanced reading copy of this book."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.129790"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.129790"]]

Years apart, each woman applies to be a tenant and each woman develop their own relationship with the man behind the design, Edward Monkford. When Jane finds out that years earlier, the previous tenant, Emma, died in the home, she begins investigating the death. Untangling a web of lies, she follows down a similar path and soon finds herself in the same danger as the girl before.The Girl Before, by JP Delaney (a pseudonym), is a book that has been getting consistent amounts of buzz in the book blogging world; I was dying to read this one!I was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy and I have to say, I have some seriously mixed feelings about this book. I found myself feeling equal parts mesmerized and strange while I was reading. What I Liked:  The Narration: the novel is narrated with alternating viewpoints from tenants at One Folgate Street: Jane, the present tenant and from Emma, the woman who lived there previously. This technique kept me glued to this book. The segmented chapters are short and sweet and use the right amount of hook to carry the story along. As the women’s experiences begin to mirror each other, things become creepy really quickly. Throwback to Gothic Literature: Fun Fact. I have always been a fan of classic gothic fiction and this novel certainly resonates with this genre. From the massive, sterile house to our female protagonists threatened by a powerful, tyrannical male, this one had moments where it read like Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho. I really liked how this one gave a modern twist on the gothic novel and combined it with the domestic thriller genre that has swept 2016 by storm.What I Didn’t Like:  Kind of gave me a Fifty Shades of Grey vibe: Edward Monkford was Christian Grey to me. The novel had moments where sexual domination took the lead and the actual story took the backburner. I have a very hard time taking a book seriously when the character, which is supposed to be the antagonist, is consistently referred to as “Daddy”. I feel like I would have enjoyed the book much more if this part of the book had taken on a smaller role. Regardless of my feelings about that portion of the book, I cannot deny that this one kept me up, late into the night, to finish. I was consumed by the plot and need to find out what happened. It already has the movie rights sold, so I will be intrigued to see how this will play out on the big screen. If you are a fan of a dark, twisting thriller, then I would recommend this book. However, if you hated the idea of Fifty Shades of Grey, then chances are, you will not appreciate this one either! Thank you to Penguin Random House Canada and the author, JP Delaney, for a copy of this one!

For Emma, she requires a safe place after being the victim of a break-in while her loyal boyfriend, Simon, was out. For Jane, it is a new place that holds no reminders of the baby she lost. For each woman, the house at One Folgate Street seems to offer exactly what they are looking for. It is designed by well-known architect, Edward Monkford, and comes with a set of rules created by the inscrutable man himself. In fact, to live at One Folgate Streets means signing off on over 200 rules, ranging from no books or personal mementos, to total tidiness, to agreeing to showing the house on architectural tours, to accepting to the intense technology that it comes with, including the house monitoring your well-being and moods. At first, the rules and clarity that come with One Folgate Street seem comforting to Emma and Jane. But as they spend more time in the house--and learn about its past, including its mysterious builder--they become terrifying and stifling. THE GIRL BEFORE is a fascinating novel told solely from the point of view of Emma, One Folgate Street's previous tenant, and Jane, its current tenant. All activities are filtered through the lens of these two women. The novel effectively builds suspense with the parallel nature of the two women's stories, but it also can get a little repetitive at times (and sometimes a little confusing, as you have to remind yourself, mostly in the beginning, who is talking). The book starts off exciting, as you are drawn into both Emma and Jane's tales while they acclimate to the house and all the oddities it offers. The house itself almost becomes another character in the novel. It starts to drag a bit halfway through as you wonder what will happen in the next half (people living in a technologically advanced house can only be so exciting, right?). But then, suddenly, the novel takes some odd turns (there are some interesting sexual plot twists) and eventually grows quite interesting again with some psychological and thrilling revelations. Perhaps my favorite part about this book is that many of these developments truly surprised me, which isn't always easy to do in a thriller. Overall, this is an interesting novel. It's certainly suspenseful and different. To enjoy it, you really have to set your disbelief aside at the actual conditions of living at One Folgate Street (no books, what?!) and accept that the two women are so broken (and perhaps broke, as the house apparently comes at a great discount) that they will go along with anything. It has a lot of varied plot threads and some of them aren't always fully explored or truly necessary, which can be a little frustrating. Still, the book truly surprised me with its twists and kept me entertained, with a deep desire to get to the end. Overall, 3.5+ stars.

While this book is being touted as the next Gone Girl/Girl on the Train (which is becoming tiresomely overused), I wish it would have been advertised as the next Fifty Shades of Grey so I would have known to steer clear. I am not surprised at all to see this novel being made into a movie adaptation and I suspect it will be quite well received by many. The relationship aspect, which was a huge part of the novel, was just not for me. I don't typically enjoy emotionally damaged women that are helpless to the charms of men simply because they are rich and handsome, nor do I enjoy novels reflecting such an uneven balance of power and/or huge red flags for an abusive relationship but the women stay because the sex is good. So those parts of the story just did not work for me. I will say, however, the mystery aspect of this book is really well done here - the plot really keeps you guessing (I didn't figure out some things until the very end) and the use of the house as a character is really very clever and effective. There is a certain level of voyeurism at play with the reader - I particularly liked playing along with the quizzes/moral dilemmas - a very successful plot device - and the introduction of life choices (how does one evaluate possessions). I also now want to incorporate karesansui into my next home (I love being introduced to new concepts). But I found myself enraged at one character that literally eats food that is absolutely abhorrent to her because she thinks it will turn a man on and another character that grossly misrepresents a sexual assault.

But this one intrigued me, and I'm glad I took the chance. This is a unique, beautifully told story.The book is written in alternating timelines, both in first person. Each character has a distinct voice and a strong personality. I didn't particularly like either woman, in that I wouldn't choose to hang out with them in my real life, so the fact that I enjoyed spending time with them fictionally speaks volumes about the author's storytelling talent. I found Jane to be a much more sympathetic character, and some of her scenes in particular were incredibly powerful. Both characters are complex and well developed.As I write this, the pre-publication promotion touts this book as a psychological thriller. 'Thriller' doesn't fit. It's far more of a slow-burning suspense. This is the type of book that gets under your skin with foreboding darkness, the hint of things to come, and the way the characters, and we as readers, remain slightly off balance throughout. Much of the story takes place within the house at One Folgate Street, with its minimalist design and enforced lifestyle. I was fascinated by the author's approach to this unique concept as a foundation for the story.My only grumbling point is a stylistic choice made by the author. Delaney does not use quotation marks for dialogue throughout Emma's POV sections. I came across this method once before in experimental literary fiction. I didn't like it then, and I didn't like it this time either. Quotation marks are subtle reading cues we don't even notice until they're missing. Their absence forced me to think more in order to figure out if sentences were being spoken aloud, thought, or were part of the narration. For me, this hurt the story's flow, as I was constantly questioning the way I interpreted things. Jane's POV sections do have quotation marks for the dialogue, so I'm not sure what the point was in choosing not to use them for Emma's parts.*I was provided with an advance ebook copy by the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for my honest review.*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.145146"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.145146"]]

One Folgate Street is an architectural masterpiece, completely minimalist in its design. But, the owner of the home, Edward, is incredibly controlling and finicky about who can live there. To be considered as a tenant for the house you must fill out a questionnaire than can only be described as bizarre and intrusive. And, there are rules to living at One Folgate Street. No throw pillows, no pets, no photos, no clutter and no books just to name a few. The story follows two women’s tenures at One Folgate Street – Emma, who is recovering from a traumatic break in and searched out a new place to call home, is the “before” and Jane, recovering from a personal tragedy, is the “now”. After Jane realizes that Emma had met a deathly end inside One Folgate Street she starts to do some investigating into Emma and what she finds is unsettling. I won’t really go into any further detail on the plot but this book is incredibly creepy and will have you hooked until the end. I couldn’t read it fast enough. Is the owner/designer of the house a dangerous man? Or is he just controlling? Was Emma murdered? Was her death an accident? Does the house have a mind of its own? There is an element here that reminded me of 50 Shades of Grey when the story delves into the sexual relationship that brews between Edward and both Jane and Emma; that is something I could have done without. This is going to be made into a movie adaptation and I think it will be a really good, creepy movie.

I was kept on my toes all the way til the end of the book and loved the little twists thrown in at the end.

Both experienced tragedies before moving into the home. They had to fill out questionnaires and send pictures and agree to a slew of rules to even be considered as renters (no simple credit check and steady job could get them into this sterile, odd place). The home won architectural awards, but residents who live there can’t leave dishes out—even the cleaning supplies are well hidden in a secret wall panel. There aren’t even book cases—no clutter is allowed whatsoever. I couldn’t imagine living like that (I wouldn’t make it a day), but both women are in dire financial situations, and the home is modestly priced because no one would live there with the millions of rules if they could afford a normal place. I couldn’t identify with Emma or Jane or the architect of the home, Edward, who is a perfectionist and possibly a sociopath (hence the creep factor).There were some nice twists and turns I didn’t see coming, which is great, but I didn’t fall in love with the ending.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jun 07, 2017"], ["review_text", "Just another thriller to add to the growing pile of subpar genre fiction. All the publishers seem focussed at the moment on finding the next Gone Girl or Girl on the Train. This is being sold in most places as a powerful new female driven thriller, or to use a buzzword, \"domestic suspense\" The writer \"feels gratified\" at how people think HE is a woman because he wrote two women so well. Yes, JP Delaney is male, and no I don't hold that against him. What I do hold against him is the fact that I wouldn't consider writing two women who portray all the stereotypical aspects of the Hysterical Woman to be writing women well. Emma-Manipulative-Unappreciative-Sex crazed-Proned to fetishism-Compulsive liarJane-Grieving the loss of a baby-Desperately wants another baby-Focussed on her career and miss out on family and love-Calculating-SecretiveEmma and Jane-Both develop an almost instant obsession with Monkford-Both seem to have sexual awakenings because of Monkford and discover they lean toward fetishism-Both spurn the same man (Simon, and to a much lesser extent, Saul) to be with Monkford-Both give up huge amounts of personal connections in order to be with Monkford and live in Fulgate Street-Both are suspicious and deceitful I really felt, as I continued to read these two women that they are each one side of a coin, making one whole woman, who, if she lacked Emma's compulsive lying and Jane's need for a baby, might just be the perfect woman. But you throw Monkford into the mix and both women become putty for the moulding. They both lose all credibility and chance for redemption the second they let Monkford control them. These aren't well written women, they're caricatures of women that men who are anti-woman think represent or resemble women as a whole. Thematically, my interest was completely lost when the grieving mother storyline entered. Not that I don't have sympathy for any mother who has lost a child, but because I can't identify with it. I feel that this theme or subplot really alienates a large section of the female readership (which is in turn a large section of general readership of all books)I am not a woman on a quest for a child and when this becomes such a prominent storyline in any book, it's like the shutters just drop and I'm thinking \"here we go again\" the woman is having her actions explained away because \"her condition made her do it\" or maybe it was \"her fragile state of mind\" If you think this is a contentious point, look at these books for examples of exactly the same device:-Pretty Baby by Mary Kubica (proof is in the title here)-The Couple Next Door by Shari Lapena (also a second rate and utterly awful book)-The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins (she was never pregnant but many of her actions are driven by the desire for her husband's new life which includes the baby that should have been here)-Leave Me by Gayle Forman (she ditches her husband and kids because they're essentially shitty people who do nothing for her then gets involved with two other people with child related issues)It would be cool if Delaney had written these women as two different kinds of villains, which is essentially what I think he was going for, but without turning them into stereotypes. Make them utterly morally repugnant, don't just hover on the border of \"hmm maybe they'll make some questionable decisions\" it's a cop out. I liked Simon as a character, I felt he had the most depth. He was the darker side to Monkford's darkness. He masquerades as the doting, adoring boyfriend who would do anything for his girlfriend or wife when he is actually using kindness as a method of control. While Monkford is outright controlling and upfront about it from the start. I hated the ending where a new character gets introduced for one chapter. This is probably a tool left in place for potential sequels, but it really irks me. Finish books properly, a really clever writer can write a sequel without leaving themselves an entry point in their previous work, just in case they get a sequel. Also, can we stop with the alternating viewpoints please? PLEASE?! It's so tired and over done. I'm at the point where I won't buy a book if this is the method of writing. I didn't think this was a revolutionary book in any way, I resent a little the hype this was given at publisher events prior to publication because it definitely didn't live up to them. It's not the next big thing and I'm not in a hurry to read anything more by this author."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.200322"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.200322"]]

There's a lot going on and it's difficult to figure it all out. I'm still not completely sure I have it all figured out. I normally don't like books like that, which leave me with questions, but in a way, it felt right with this book. The whole book has an air of mystery and it feels ok to leave something on the table.This is also the kind of book where no one really comes out looking great.

Представете си една безупречна, фантастична къща с много светлина, простор и минималистичен стил, чийто собственик е известен архитект. На пръв поглед изглежда невъзможно точно тази перфектна къща да бъде следващото ви жилище.Модерната сграда на „Фолгейт Стрийт 1“ е като от онези снимки в списанията – изглежда недостижима и специална и в нея не може да живее всеки. Даа, сигурно трява да има някаква уловка, би било твърде хубаво, за да е истина, нали така?Изобщо не се учудвам, че романът вече е преведен на 39 езика и се е превърнал в бестселър, който предстои да бъде екранизиран под режисурата на носителя на „Оскар“ Рон Хауърд, известен с филми като „Аполо 13“, „Красив ум“ и „Шифърът на Леонардо“. И да, неслучайно сравняват „Момичето преди“ с „Не казвай сбогом“. Предричам, че много ще се говори за тази книга и тепърва ще я виждам в ръцете на мнозина – в метрото, на пейката в парка, на плажа…„Момичето преди“ е точно това, което търся в един криминален роман – необикновена история, чиято сюжетна линия да ме грабне, да ме накара да прелиствам шеметно страниците и да ме остави удовлетворена след прочита. Психологическият трилър деликатно засяга и доста социални теми, което за мен го прави още по-пълноценен. Така че, ако сте фенове на този жанр и си търсите нещо добро за четене, горещо препоръчвам да се запознаете с „Момичето преди“!Цялото ревю - тук: http://azcheta.com/momicheto-predi-dz..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.238889"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.238889"]]

Es scheint zu schön um wahr zu sein, die Wohnung ist sehr günstig und dazu noch hochmodern ausgestattet. Allerdings ist der Einzug in diese 4 Wände an eine Vielzahl von obskuren Regeln gebunden, die das Architekten Team aufgestellt hat. .Es darf nichts auf dem Boden herumliegen, es gibt keine Papierkörbe, keine Wäscheleinen und keine Sofakissen – Treppengeländer und Absicherungen stehen genauso auf der Verbotsliste wie natürlich Haustiere und Kinder. .Trotzdem überlegt Jane nicht lang, da sie sowieso ihr Leben ändern möchte und einen kompletten Neuanfang wünscht und willigt ein. .Parallel zu Janes Geschichte lesen wir immer wieder Abschnitte aus der Vergangenheit von der direkten Vormieterin Emma die auf tragische Weise in eben diesem Haus ums Leben gekommen ist. Auch Jane ist auf das Mysterium um Emmas Tod gestoßen und beginnt zu forschen. Sie findet heraus, dass die beiden Frauen sich nicht nur sehr sehr ähnlich sehen, sondern auch, dass ihre Geschichten um die Folgate Street 1 auch exakt gleich abgelaufen sind! .Bedeutet das nun etwa, dass auch Jane diesem Haus zum Opfer fallen wird? Und was hat überhaupt der verschrobene, perfektionistische aber gutaussehende Architekt Edward Monkford mit der ganzen Sache zu tun?Dieses Buch hat es geschafft, mich von der ersten bis zur Letzten Seite zu fesseln. Zwar war mir Emma nicht durchweg sympathisch, aber sie war authentisch und das ist das wichtigste! Ich habe total mitgerätselt wie das alles nun zusammenhängt und bin durch viele Wendungen gegangen die ich so nicht erahnt hätte, das Ende war sehr überraschend aber es passte perfekt und erschien nicht konstruiert.Klare Leseempfehlung von meiner Seite aus wenn ihr auf Psychothriller steht!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.241910"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.241910"]]

It was only the beginning but I could feel myself being frightened by the eerie sense the story gave. By this alone, I was amazed by how the author could do this to my reading experience so very quickly.One Folgate Street is very secure and private. It has the latest technology for the security system. The house comes with a whole set of rules and is set for a simple lifestyle without the added essentials of our lives. The house felt like a character in the story and it's what elevated the creepy feel.\"It has—well, it's a pretentious word, but it has integrity. I think he's looking for people who are prepared to be equally honest  about the way they live in.\"Emma is an unreliable, unlikable character who has issues. She went through a burglary and a possible sexual assault, which is what leads her to want to move out of her home and search for a safe place to start over. One Folgate house is the perfect place to start fresh, especially after what she went through. She meets Edward, who's the architect of the One Folgate House. Very soon, they start dating and Emma loves all the attention she receives from him. Unfortunately, something happens that ends with Emma being dead.Perhaps the house will turn me into a better person. Perhaps it will bring order and discipline to the random chaos of my life.Jane is a strong, independent, brave woman who went through a miscarriage. After the miscarriage, she quit her job and found a job in helping other mom's who go through miscarriages. Because of this, her income is low, but the prices for an apartment or house are high. One Folgate Street is the only one that Jane can afford. She sends in her application and is accepted. She feels very safe in the house and is happy with her decision of living there. When she starts seeing Edward, a few questions arise and slowly, she starts to question her relationship and her living situation.But what if the house itself decides not to protect me? How safe am I really?Edward is a controlling, manipulative man that I found myself being disgusted by. At first, I was kind of liking him and drawn to him, but when he treats Emma in the past the same way he treats Jane in the present, says the same things, gifts the same things, I was just appalled and creeped out by him. His character did enhance the eerie feel of the story, which I did like a lot. I couldn't figure out his motives and that still made him interesting to me.\"Excellence is what matters. Excellence and originality.\"The last two chapters of the story had me saying WTF so many times. I have no idea how many times I re-read those pages. I'm telling you, there's a whiplash at every turn the story makes! The story had lots of twists that had me doing a double-take and re-reading the pages because I couldn't believe what was happening.The Girl Before is a mindblowing and addicting masterpiece that left me completely transfixed and fascinated.This review was originally posted on Latte Nights Reviews."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.274299"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.274299"]]

The premise is great, if rather batty (who would honestly agree to live in a house with so many restrictive rules. You’re not allowed books! Come on!). The story is entertaining with an impressive number of twists to keep you guessing. When it comes to uncovering who was responsible for Emma’s death, there are enough plausible suspects to keep you intrigued.On the whole it’s easy to read, although the dialogue in Emma’s chapters isn’t marked off by inverted commas, which can slow the pace down as you try to separate speech from thought.And, if you like creepy, this book delivers it in spades. As the story alternates between “Emma chapters” in the past and “Jane chapters” in the present, the parallels between the women’s experiences are gradually revealed and the similarities at times, particularly in their relationships with Edward, made me shudder.However, I have issues with the sexual politics of a story in which the two main characters are largely ok with having a narcissist trying to control them. I can’t really say more than that because it could be giving away some major plot points (sorry!).I also felt things started to go haywire in the last quarter of the book as the twisting and turning went too far, pushing the plot from far-fetched to ridiculous. So while I wasn’t bored for a single second while reading The Girl Before, I have to confess to a fair bit of tutting and eye-rolling.Overall: fans of creepy psychological thrillers will love The Girl Before. I’m sure it will be very successful and I look forward to seeing how closely the upcoming film adaptation sticks to the book.Thank you to Quercus Books and NetGalley for the e-ARC."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.277425"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.277425"]]

Hier habe ich mir eine spannende und ereignisreiche Geschichte erhofft und diese auch größtenteils erhalten.Ich muss gestehen, dass ich anfangs ein paar Probleme mit der Geschichte hatte, denn der Anfang war doch sehr zäh, sodass ich mich auf den ersten 50-75 Seiten ganz schön durchbeißen musste. Danach konnte mich die Geschichte jedoch immer mehr packen, sodass ich letztendlich doch eine spannende Geschichte vorgefunden habe.Erzählt wird hierbei die Geschichte von Jane, die es im Leben nicht immer leicht hatte und von daher dringend einen Tapetenwechsel benötigt. Das Glück steht ihr dabei auf der Seite, denn sie darf in ein modernes Haus in einem angesehenen Stadtteil in London ziehen. Als sie dazu noch Edward kennen lernt, dem das Haus gehört, scheint ihr Glück zunächst perfekt zu sein, denn sie beginnt eine Affäre mit ihm und glaubt, dass ihr Leben nun besser wird. Dieses Leben beginnt jedoch immer mehr zu bröckeln, als Jane erfährt, dass es bereits eine andere Frau in diesem Haus gab, die ihr nicht nur sehr ähnlich sah, sondern dazu in dem Haus verstorben ist. Dabei kommt es auch immer zu Erlebnissen aus der Vergangenheit aus der Sicht von Emma, die in dem Haus verstorben ist.Die Geschichte ist trotz kleinerer Schwächen stets spannend. Zwar gibt es auch hier die ruhigeren Momente, die sich stellenweise ein wenig ziehen, allerdings erlebt man hier insgesamt eine interessante Geschichte mit vielseitigen Figuren, die zwar nicht immer sympathisch sind, in die man sich aber dennoch in gewisser Art und Weise hineinversetzen kann. Das Cover passt gut zur Geschichte, gleichzeitig erkennt man auch direkt das Genre und eine düstere Stimmung, was ebenfalls gut zur Geschichte passt. Die Kurzbeschreibung liest sich spannend und hat direkt mein Interesse geweckt, sodass ich \"The Girl Before\" sehr gerne eine Chance gegeben habe.Kurz gesagt: \"The Girl Before\" ist ein interessanter und spannender Thriller mit vielseitigen Figuren, der zwar am Anfang seine Zeit braucht und auch um kleinere Längen nicht herumkommt, mich aber letztendlich dennoch überzeugen konnte, sodass ich das Buch gerne gelesen haben. Wer bereits Bücher von Paula Hawkins mochte, sollte auch JP Delaney eine Chance geben!

The book tells the story of Emma and Jane, both tenants at One Folgate Street, a house that is a minimalist's and architect's dream. The house was designed by famed architect Edward Monkton. He still owns the house but rents it out to people he deems worthy. Prospective tenants have to complete a questionnaire, a personal interview, and agree to the 200 rules he imposes. Despite all the restrictions, he manages to find people who want to live there.The book alternates points of view, and chapters, between Emma and Jane. Emma is the past tenant, Jane is the current one. There are similarities between the two women. Both are victims of recent tragedies. Emma is traumatized by a recent break-in at her home that occurred while she was there. Jane by the still birth of her first child. Both women are looking for a fresh start and feel that One Folgate Street can provide that.We learn early on that Emma died in the house. It is unsure if the death was an accident, a suicide or murder. When Jane learns of Emma's death, she begins to investigate it. The alternating chapters really hi-light the similarities between Emma and Jane's experiences in the house. Seeing them making some of the same choices, really increases the tension. This book is a psychological thriller. Between Edward's increasingly controlling behavior, and what we learn about Emma and Jane's lives, the reader just doesn't know what to think. Did Edward kill Emma? Is Jane now in danger from him? Or was someone else to blame? We don't find out what actually happens until the very end.I thought this was an enjoyable book. It was fun and easy to read. The chapters were all short and fast paced. I would recommend this book to my friends who are looking for a nice escapist read.I received a free ARC from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.288131"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.288131"]]

One ended up dead and the other one who comes after her is determined to find out the truth.Sounds interesting? Yes it really is. I was really mesmerized by Edward the mysterious architect. He is possibly a psycho and I am tense waiting for the big reveleation in which he finally reveal his true self. Also this is told by the alternating POVs of Emma and Jane. We gotta read the events leading up to Emma's death. The whole story was pretty good up until that ending. Nothing really explains and I don't even understand how it all happens(view spoiler)[ What is Edward's deal? why he gotta repeat the same events with 2 different woman?What is the purpose of this house?Those are the questions been bugging me. It seems like Edward's character is merely a distraction or a decoration  (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.291001"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.291001"]]

Emma is the past resident of the house and Jane is the current resident. It was a great way to present the story.-The ending was a real surprise but it was plausible - I realized that I had missed some clues along the way.What I didn't Like - There was too much unneeded sex.-I am so tired of book titles with the word GIRLS in them when the characters are actually WOMEN.Overall, I thought it was a great read and I definitely enjoyed it.Thanks to Book Browse for a copy of this book.

Emma and Jane are two damaged women who are both separately searching for a home that will provide them with the qualities they are desperately seeking: security, safety, and peace. They find it at One Folgate Street. This story is told in two different POVs: one by Jane and the other by Emma. One of them is living in the present and the other in the past. One is still alive and the other is dead. Their reasons for searching for a peaceful, quiet and minimalist location to live in may be different, but have caused them great pain. The one thing they do share is who they fall in love with. Enigmatic, mysterious and alpha-male Edward is what most women tend to fantasize about. Edward is intelligent, successful and handsome. He lives an incredibly strict and innately detailed lifestyle. Those he chooses as tenants to live at One Folgate Street need to abide by his stringent and lengthy contract. There are very few who would be willing to give everything up to live there, but for Emma and Jane it's exactly what they're looking for.As time goes on, the beautiful and pristine home can't keep them blinded from the truth forever. As time goes on, they begin to suspect that underneath that immaculate exterior lies a secret so dark and deadly that it may cost them their lives. This was a great story! I usually love reading books that are very fast paced, but I had no problem getting absorbed into this novel. I found it to be enthralling with just the right amount of suspense and character growth.

Part of me liked it very much, a big part. But I've got some niggles with it, and in writing this review, it might help me understand my feels a bit.LikedThe state-of-the-art home where our two protagonists lived. It was a breathtakingly impressive place, which had all the gizmos and gadgets cleverly hidden away to create a perfect minimalistic living space. I'd have to break some rules to live there though. Books and cushions.Characters with unlikable traits. Yeah, I do like that. I enjoy their flawed and twisted personas and trying to fathom them out. The subtle hint of kink. Yep, these were not vanilla folk. The author brought just enough to give it some sizzle, without too much detail. Some things are best left to the readers imagination. Learning about Japanese cuisine. There's far more to it than sushi and friggin hot wasabi. (See also 'Disliked')How the two MC's POV's and stories merged as the story progressed.DislikedThe first 30-40%. I just couldn't get to grips with it! Those two girls, both with simple names, Jane and Emma. I couldn't for the life of me distinguish between them initially. I resorted to having a scrap of paper by my side whilst reading, with 'Jane, - present, Emma, - past' scribbled on it so I knew whose voice I was hearing. It's mad, it could of been just me, but I really had issues with those names. Both four letters, both very British, both rather samey. I dunno. *shrugs*It had a half-way-through-major-eyeball-rolling-moment. It was predictable and typical.Learning about Japanese cuisine. Urghhhh! Is that shit for real? No way. Nope. Stay away from my mouth.So, my conclusion is, that, yes, it was a unique story experience, with twists that kept me engrossed until the end, but it wasn't sensational.Thank you to NetGalley and Quercus Books for the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.335533"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.335533"]]

One Folgate Street was originally going to be built to be the family home of world famous architect, Edward Monkford but when his wife and child are killed, he rips up the plans and designs a unique house that molds the renter fit the house. There is an almost impossible list of questions and stipulations that must be agreed to by the prospective renter and even then it has to be approved by Edward Monkford. What first attracts people is the price. It is extremely reasonable and once they get used to the seeming austerity of the house, the beauty.The first renter in the book is Emma and her boyfriend Simon. They have just had a break-in at their current apartment that has left Emma fearful for her safety. Emma has found security problems at all the other apartments they have seen. One Folgate Street offers total security. To enter or use anything in the place they must wear a band that lets the place know you belong there. The sensors built into the house operate everything. Emma and Simon fall in love with the place and they apparently answered the questions satisfactorily as Edward Monkford approves their application. But soon after they move in, it becomes only Emma. Simon is thrown out of the picture and I believe it is mainly to do with Emma's initial attraction to Edward.The Girl Before fluctuates between Emma and Jane. The current resident is Jane and Emma is the girl before but we only learns what happened to Emma and what is happening to Jane as both their stories unfold. What happens to Jane has a lot to do with her curiosity about what happened to Emma. Both of them are wounded souls, Emma because of the break-in and Jane because of a stillborn baby.Both become intimately involved with Edward. He is very handsome, mysterious and domineering. Emma wants a man to take charge of her. She looks back on Simon as being too meek. She wants a man to dominate and protect her. She finds Edward all to willing to fill that role but he makes it very clear that he believes in short term intense relationships. Emma, like many women in relationships, believes that she will be the one to change her man. Unfortunately Emma seems to find lying easier than telling the truth and her lies start unravelling and so does her life.At one point in this book I consider putting it aside because Edward is coming across as super creepy. I decide to continue further and I'm glad I did. The book takes hold of me and pulls me in to the point where I have a hard time putting it down.Jane comes to live at One Folgate Street after the her stillborn birth of her daughter Isobel. She is vulnerable and Edward sees that and they too begin an affair. I don't understand why all these women are drawn to Edward Monkford. Too me he just comes across as creepy and the book wants you to see him as the villain of the story. Jane agrees to all of the demands asked of her to live in the house but her character is stronger than Emma's. She has noticed the similarity of Edward's deceased wife, Emma and herself. She starts investigating what happened to Emma but to keep what she's doing a secret from the house, Jane must go to a corner of her bedroom so she can use the neighbor's WiFi.In the end she survives an encounter with an unsuspected danger and proves that she was using Edward as he was using her. I am very glad that I continued reading through to the end.In the author's write up JP Delaney is revealed to be the pen names for someone who is already successful under possibly 2 different names. I thought of Nora Roberts with her JD Robb series or JK Rowling with her Cormoran Strike mysteries. It will most likely come out eventually but it is a neat twist.I received this book as a member of Suzanne Beecher's First Look Book Club and courtesy of Penguin Random House and I have given my honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.378822"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.378822"]]

In other words, I loved it. In a strange and twisted way. Just like everything is in this novel. It starts with an absurd concept, and you think, it can't get any worse but it does. Oh dear, it does. It crawls under your skin, shakes your bones, makes you sick in the night. It's messed up. In an eerie and beautiful way. Moreover, The Girl Before raises many controversial questions of the 21st century. This novel challenges you in every possible way. First, it makes you write the list of all of your essential possessions. Emphasis on essential. So, cross out that eyeliner and fuzzy slippers. Then, it makes you live in the house where 95% of people before haven't even lasted longer than a couple weeks. The house is indeed an architectural masterpiece created with a purpose of changing the resident. It's so sterile, you feel like a blank canvas - ready for a new start. And the house will either force you to start over or force you out. One Folgate Street's goal is to make your physical and emotional well-being better. That is the first question The Girl Before brings you to, shall architects create \"buildings with a sense of purpose?\"Second, it makes you a subject to a house. One Folgate Street is an amazing creation. I was absolutely fascinated by a house that monitors health and well-being of the tenant. The house is equipped with all sorts of sensors, therefore creating the most pleasant environment. The lights, the temperature, the water, the AC, the appliances - the house adjusts everything up to tenant's physical and emotional parameters. It's insane. It's beautiful. It's genius. It's future. That brings you to the second question, would collection of physical and emotional parameters with the goal of general improvement cause the conflict between privacy and technology? Third, it makes you reconsider your social choices. Because, honestly, what is going on in The Girl Before is equally messed up to Gone Girl. I am not exaggerating. It's like ice-cold water in the face, a wake-up call, a horrible realization, a gun to the head. Who do you trust? Who do you lie to? Who lies to you? All and no one. Everyone is this book is goddamn insane but so bloody real. Personalities are amplified, yes, but, honey, they are real. And they make you wonder, to what extent actions can be justified by love? I read The Girl Before on my trip to New Orleans at night. This made the reading experience even creepier. I was not able to close my eyes until the next day, and this heavy feeling was gnawing upon me the entire day. I finished the novel over three weeks ago but I still can't stop thinking about it and the residents of One Folgate Street. I feel haunted. I feel heartbroken.

The focus moves between the lives and experiences of Emma Matthews (‘Then’) and Jane Cavendish (‘Now’) at One Folgate Street in London, UK. One Folgate Street is a minimalist house designed by a reclusive architect, Edward Monkford. Those who seek to live there need to fill in a lengthy application form, and will need to abide by some 200 conditions stipulated under a restrictive covenant if their application is approved. Very few applicants are approved.‘It’s an extraordinarily tight contract.’Then: Emma Matthews likes One Folgate Place: she feels safe there. After a burglary in her last place, she is looking for security. Emma and her boyfriend Simon move in.Now: Jane Cavendish is looking for a new home. Somewhere to recover after the sudden death of her baby daughter just days before her birth.The novel shifts between ‘Then’ and ‘Now’, between Emma and Jane. Clearly Emma and Simon are no longer living at One Folgate Street when Jane moves in. But when Jane discovers that Emma died at One Folgate Street, she becomes curious about the girl who lived there before her.‘It seems One Folgate Street has a somewhat tragic history, he says.’So, what happened to Emma Matthews and her boyfriend Simon? Why are the tenancy rules so inflexible for One Folgate Street? Who is Edward Monkford, and why has he designed One Folgate Street in such a controlled, minimalist fashion? You’ll need to read the book to try to find the answers to these questions The more pages I turned, the more I became caught up in the story. My own brief obsession (I read the novel over two days) was to find out what had happened to Emma. While there are many disturbing similarities between Emma’s story and Jane’s, there are some significant differences. And just when I thought I’d worked out what happened to Emma, another twist would have me looking in another direction. It’s claustrophobic and obsessive, and I can understand why Universal has bought the film rights.Did I enjoy this novel? Yes, mostly. I had envisaged a slightly different ending, but I’m not disappointed. I’d like to know more about the author, though: J.P. Delaney is, apparently, a pseudonym for an author who has ‘previously written bestselling fiction under other names’.Note: My thanks to Hachette Australia and NetGalley for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.388820"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.388820"]]

My thanks to the author and his/her publisher.Has anyone else noticed that there are a slew of books in the past few years that have included the “Girl…” in their titles? The 'Girl' In The Title: More Than A Marketing TrendHere's a trend in new books: Publishers commonly promote them by comparing them to other books — and when the books are crime fiction or thrillers, and written by women, they get compared to the same books again and again and again.

Of course, there were a few things I didn’t like so much:•\\tFirstly, there were several 2 page chapters. There needed to be more space and development between alternating points of view. I am not an idiot; I can remember similar occurrences that happened between the two girls and Edward without it having to be repeated hard on the heels of each other.•\\tI would have liked the relationship between Emma and her psychiatrist to have been developed a bit more.

Especially if they're lackluster (though I do admit that I wasn't all that impressed with Gone Girl and it's my least favorite Flynn novel). This is my fault, really. I hate that mystery books are all compared to GG and GOTT, but I still pick them up, even though I've been burned time and time again. Unfortunately for me, The Girl Before was yet another burn.The Girl Before tries to be this edgy, steamy thriller that has shades of GG and 50 Shades of Grey. The thing is that it fails in every conceivable way. Mind you, I haven't read 50 Shades of Grey (and will never, ever read it due to how it seems to fetishize controlling behavior), but The Girl Before seems to have tried to captivate the same kind of steaminess (or rather try to captivate the people who considered FSOG steamy and not just icky w/ it's control factor). But it's not steamy, it's icky. And it's not edgy, it's just the same predictable mess that's come from all of the other GG wannabes.My main issue with The Girl Before is that the women are stupid. The main characters fall under the \"stupid characters do stupid, stupid things\" category. The Emma chapters were just a mess. Pretty much the author trying to throw everything, but the kitchen sink in there. They were so implausible (and that whole \"Daddy\" thing? Icky as fuck). And what was with writing the Emma chapters without quotation marks? Was it to differentiate the Emma chapters from the Jane chapters? Well, it worked. Cause I differentiated them by thinking, \"Oh, here are the Jane chapters and here are the pretentious, special snowflake without quotation marks chapters.\" It was so annoying and so unnecessary.Jane was no better. If Emma was pathetic, Jane was ten times worse. She gets all this evidence that Edward might not be a good dude and she constantly ignores it. She doesn't want to take anything those people tell her at face value, but has no problem taking what Edward tells her at face value. In fact, she's so pathetic that she wonders why all these guys are obsessed with Emma, while simultaneously lamenting that no one is obsessed with her. Really? You're upset because no one seems to be stalking you? Go home, Jane. You're drunk. So what does The Girl Before have going for it? It's a page-turner. That's it. Besides that, it's a mess. It's predictable, the least unique book you'll ever read, and full of unlikable characters who deserve to get hit by trains.

When I’d put down the book and pick it up a few hours later, I couldn’t remember which event/thing happened to which girl, because the story-lines were too similar. The whole book was too disjointed, simply because the two P.O.V. were too much alike.And what really bothered me about Emma’s chapters were the absence of quotation marks. I completely loath when writers feel the need to do this. Half the time, you can’t even tell who’s talking in Emma’s chapters, because, like I stated, there are no quotation marks. It was a big guessing game: Are these Emma’s thoughts, or is she speaking out loud? It’s such a headache to read a story with dialogue that breaks one of the most important rules of grammar. The lack of “” was distracting to the story and very off putting. \\tThe writing itself was sort of dry. A lot of “says…insert adverb here (drily, tartly, etc)” \\tI also found bits of this story to be too far-fetched. I don’t care how fancy or nice a house like One Folgate Street is, no one in their right mind would live in a place with so many rules and restrictions. I mean, no furniture? No books? Although, as much as I’d like to say the technology inside the house was teetering on the edge of science fiction, it really wasn’t. I can see variations of smart houses like One Folgate Street popping up in the future. \\tThis book did have its creepy moments, but it wasn’t exactly thriller or hair raising if you know what I mean. Yes, the house was eerie, but it wasn’t scary. \\tOn a good note, there were a couple twists and turns within the story that surprised me, and this really is a book you don’t want to put down. And, I did get The Girl on the Train vibe towards the second half of the novel which is always a good thing. \\tThank you to NetGalley/the publisher for this ARC. This is my honest, unbiased review!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.399447"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.399447"]]

I love books that have a resolved ending that leaves me feeling satisfied about the outcome. :DThe Girl Before follows the story of Emma (in the past) and Jane (in the present). It's a story about a house (One Folgate Street) that is a perfect home for people who want a nice house but can't afford an expensive one. But why is it so cheap? The one condition to purchasing this home is that you have to agree follow The Rules and be accepted after a strict application process, which most people don't pass.Emma is looking for a new start after her and her boyfriend's apartment was violently broken into while she was home alone. A little further in the future, Jane suffers the death of her perfect baby girl and wants to start over in a new home that doesn't remind her of the baby. Neither one of them can afford an expensive home, and they both are amazed by the simplicity and minimalist style of One Folgate Street. To apply for the house, the women fill out a long questionnaire with seemingly odd and sometimes personal questions and send photos of themselves along with it. Both of them send in their applications and receive an interview with Edward Monkford, the architect of the home. Monkford is gorgeous but controlling, and both women are drawn to him.Soon after she moves in, Jane finds out that the woman who lived in the house before her (Emma) had died under strange circumstances. She also finds out that she bears a striking resemblance to Emma - and to Monkford's late wife. Jane becomes obsessed with Emma's story and finding out what happened to her. I don't want to ruin anything so I'll stop there!The writing was very well thought-out and I really liked the way that it was told. The alternating chapters of Emma's POV (in the past) and Jane's POV (in the present) fit together really well. I thought that it was full of suspense and the ending was definitely not expected. Also, readers will never guess who \"the girl before\" is. I thought I had it figured out early on but I was wrong. The whole book was brilliant, in my opinion.Copy provided by Netgalley for a review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.404909"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.404909"]]

Yes it did - I raced through it in two days.One Folgate Street in London, England, is a architectural wonder. It is minimalism to the extreme. Stone, glass, white on white, no doors. And much is controlled by the Housekeeper - a computer program that takes its cues from the bracelet that the inhabitants wear.And who lives there? Only those chosen by the architect - after undergoing a rigorous application. And acceptance of the many rules of the house - no mess everything must be out of sight, no photos, no colour and much more.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"After a break-in, Emma see living in the house as safe, a sanctuary against danger. After her divorce, Jane sees the house as a clean slate, a new start. Emma lived at Folgate before Jane.The Girl Before is told in alternating chapters from Jane and Emma - now and then. When Jane learns of the previous tenant's death, she becomes consumed with finding out more - even though she is discouraged by the enigmatic Edward, the architect/owner. The reader is privy to the events during Emma's time in the house. And knowing what we know, the tension ratchets up as Jane seems to be following in her footsteps - and into danger......I felt like I should be on Emma and Jane's 'side', if you will. But as the book progressed and more of their personalities and their (questionable) choices are revealed, I found I didn't overly like either of them. But I still desperately wanted to know what next. Edward - well, he's in his own category. And I'm not too sure why either of them find him so appealing, but hey, this book wouldn't be the same without him being this way. Control, it's all about control with this guy. In his life and in his house. Super creepy.Gentle readers be warned - there are a few somewhat graphic sex scenes.Just get yourself past accepting that anyone would actually move into a house such as this with crazy rules and you are in for a deliriously addictive, psychologically twisty turny read with a nice little gotcha in the end."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.423733"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.423733"]]

Can architecture make social and personal interventions? These questions get raised but are ultimately subsumed beneath a pretty standard 'psychological' thriller: characters are damaged, pathological liars, psychopaths hidden in plain sight, and obsessive-compulsives with a bit of sexual exhibitionism thrown in for good measure and a couple of murders.The writing is smoother than is often the case in this kind of commercial fiction: the sections are very short, sometimes only half a page, at most a couple of pages, switching between Emma 'then' and Jane 'now'. There's lots of misdirection going on but personally I feel it's cheating to have twists that depend on 1st person narrators simply lying to us...So an enjoyable piece of fluff that I whizzed through in one sitting: I'd like to see Delaney do something more intelligent with the intriguing ideas that get suggested here but which ultimately have little to do with the plot.

This is a pseudonym for an author who has already published fiction under another name and you could tell that this wasn’t their first rodeo so to speak.The Girl Before is a psychological thriller that will have you guessing from the get go as the present and the past go on an eerily similar journey. This story is told in two point of views, Emma (The Girl Before) and Jane the present. Emma took up residency at One Folgate Street after an aggravated burglary left her with a crippling fear of living in her old house. The new house had to be high security to give her that “safe” feeling and One Folgate Street was the only property that fitted the bill. One Folgate Street was the brainchild of top architect, Edward Monkford and was as high spec as they came and extremely minimalist. Only tenants willing to go through an intense veto process and adhere to some two hundred rules could live there and that meant giving up everything that you didn’t need, living with the bare necessities and living clean and tidy. The house had a brain as it were and monitored the residents, adapting to their day to day routines, their preferences and their dislikes. It was a social experiment of sorts and one that the residents knew they were a part of, hence the affordable rent for an otherwise unobtainable property. \n  \n    “You can make your surroundings as polished and empty as you like. But it doesn’t really matter if you’re still messed up inside.”\n  \nJane is the current resident of One Folgate Street and is currently coming to terms with losing a child and One Folgate Street is her clean break and fresh start. Jane fell in love with the property and is immediately taken by its creator but it is not long before the walls begin to bleed their secrets. Once Jane becomes aware of the tragic past of the property she takes it upon herself to investigate…with startling revelations. Will the present mimic the past? \n  \n    “There was a time when One Folgate Street seemed like a calm, serene haven. Now it doesn’t. It feels claustrophobic and aggressive. Like the house is angry with me.”\n  \nI will say that because Emma and Jane’s stories were so startling similar at times, it did become hard to keep track of whose point of view I was currently reading. I found myself flipping back to the beginning of chapters when the characters began to blur. I did notice that Emma’s point of view did not contain any speech marks, if this was a way of differentiating between the two it didn’t work for me, it only made reading those chapters a tad confusing. It may be that there was a different method behind this style of writing but it wasn’t immediately apparent.\n  \n    “Never apologize for someone you love, he says quietly. It makes you look like a prick.”\n  \nThis was an addictive read though, one that I couldn’t put down. JP Delaney cleverly built this story, slowly peeling back his characters like the layers of an onion. As each layer is removed the character’s secrets became fewer, the truth more apparent and I was anxiously waiting to reach the centre. With each chapter, the more engrossed I became and while the beginning is a little slow to get going, it soon becomes apparent that the pacing was deliberate in its lure to totally submerse you in Emma and Jane’s story. This was a clever manipulation of the mind as your brain screams at you to believe one thing, yet your subconscious tells you another. Do you rule with your heart, head or your gut instinct?I did have a few issues with The Girl Before, hence the rating, but as psychological thrillers went this certainly held my attention from the start and left me with that constant fear of woe throughout. I did feel that the ending was rushed and did not feel any particular closure with Edward and Jane and while I could see where the author wanted to go at the end, its delivery let it down. While this book does stretch your imagination at times, I am sure that someone, somewhere has already invented a house like this, whether I would want to be a part of it…hell no and I did find myself struggling to come to terms with the residents willing participation. Sometimes though the allure of grandeur knocks all common sense from people and picking on an already vulnerable person was probably the kick starter to garner anyone’s interest. However, it was gripping, it had my mind running a mile a minute, even taking notes as I tried to decipher fact from fiction, truth from lies and throw those red herrings overboard. I am usually wrong, I would be a crap detective but I did get this one right.\n  \n    “I built something as simple as a mausoleum because that was how I felt at the time. But then I realised that in my madness I’d inadvertently created something extraordinary. A house that would demand a sacrifice from anyone who lived there, but which would repay that sacrifice a thousand-fold. There are some it destroys… But some it makes stronger.”\n  \nThis is soon to become a film, I can see the allure and personally cannot wait to see how this is depicted on the big screen.www.theromancecover.com"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.444385"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.444385"]]

But in this case, there were moments where I genuinely felt like I was reading a  Gone Girl rip-off. There were other moments that felt like a carbon copy of  The Girl on the Train. And, because apparently we needed to make matters even worse, this book also felt like it had healthy dashes of  Fifty Shades of Grey thrown in there. Cue me throwing up.What is this book about? Two women, separated by a couple years, going through the same process of moving into a new home and starting affairs with the architect who built it. His house comes with hundreds of rules to ensure that every detail of the tenant's life is like something out of a wet dream of Marie Kondo. His relationships come with just as many regulations. I think the point where I wanted to throw the book across the room in disgust was when this man told one of his lovers that she should groom her pubic hair because it wasn't perfectly symmetrical....but there were a million things just like this. He was possibly the most vomit-inducing love interest I have ever read about. Having to witness not one but TWO women fall for this guy was torturous. The two timelines have so many similarities IT IS LIKE READING THE EXACT SAME BOOK TWICE. WHY.The ~mystery~ aspect was lacking. I felt like J.P Delaney was trying desperately hard to cram in as many shocking moments as possible but it wasn't done in any sort of original way so I could predict everything because it was all so overdone. And this is coming from someone who rarely reads thrillers. I felt like so many of the reveals just involved a character turning out to be some sort of general \"crazy person.\" This is not only boring but also just offensive. Some of the most intense moments of the book were actually cartoonishly ridiculous to me. There's a plotline about rape that I found EXTREMELY disappointing and absolutely unforgivable. If this is something you're sensitive about, I recommend skipping this book completely but I'll add a spoiler about this in case you need it: (view spoiler)[Basically, it's very triggering and graphic and then it turns out that the rape allegations were completely false. The protagonist actually accuses two separate men of raping her and then two OTHER men of abusing her. The abuse is pretty minor compared to the rape in terms of attention in the plot. But yeah. It's all absolutely shitty. I have very low tolerance for false rape allegations in fiction.

The mutual setting is an unusual apartment - one that is a living model of high architecture - designed by an enigmatic architect. Emma and Jane narrate two different narratives that bring them to live at this unusual residence at separate times. While different circumstances brought them to their new home, their lives share similarities - particularly as they abide by the stringent rules set by the architect - and later by their relationship with the architect himself. Both women, too, are haunted by the titular girl before - in Emma's case, she becomes obsessed with the first wife of the architect, while Jane becomes obsessed with Emma.The chapters alternate between the two women and the similarities (and later, the differences) really amplifies the tension. As echoes of the two women's lives ring out across the whole, it really makes this an absorbing read. The plot moves along at a fast pace and does involve more surprises to the plot than I expected. At first, the book really feels like a straightforward read and each woman's actions and investigations adds complexity to the plot and their characters. Jane's section in particular has a tragic backstory, that may be a bit too sad for some readers. But, overall, it is an exciting and engaging read. The conclusion fits nicely, too.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jan 26, 2017"], ["review_text", "When choosing a book to read I often follow my gut feeling, especially when it comes to the authors that I don't know - although JP Delaney is a pen name for a best - selling author, and when reading \"The Girl Before\" I was looking for any hallmarks but I didn't guess the real name - and when spotting this book I just had a feeling that this could be THE read. And well, yes, it turned out that I should trust my gut feeling as the book was totally engrossing and kept me glued to the pages. \"The Girl Before\" was a provocative, incredibly smart story about controlling and manipulations, making reader to ask who is reliable there and whom shall we trust.Now. \"The Girl Before\". We can start debating who the hell would go and live voluntarily in a house with 200 stipulations including no pets (no way), no children, no cushions, no curtains, no personal things on the floor, no books (hello?). And yet they signed on the dotted line. The house itself is an example of minimalism and the latest and best home technology, adjusting itself to the weather, temperature and probably the mood of the inhabitants. Originally designed by Edward Monkton as his family home but there was an accident on the site when his wife and his young son died. Also, he is the one who, after interviewing the prospective renters, is to decide if they're going to live there or not. Weird, no? Who in their right mind would go for something like this? I wouldn't, and I don't want to go into this debate, but I thought that it is a brilliant and unique idea and premise for a book. For me the book sounded unique, not like others books that I read, and the only thing that didn't work so good for me was the end, that sounded too Disney-like and somehow didn't sit with the book. However, this is probably the only thing that I'm going to criticise. There were maybe some things that made me feel uncomfortable, just like building the house on the grave or some scenes with abuse - both human and animal - but nothing that would make me cringe.The story alternates between Emma (Then) and Jane (Now), and the chapters were short and dynamic and it also made the story flow and reading much quicker. It was also the writing that makes this book so outstanding. It is sparse, but it is incredibly hooking and just beautiful - we can say just like the house! It just feels like the house, to be honest, white and with no barriers or unnecessary things and beautiful in its frugality. The way the stories of Emma and Jane mirrored made me feel a little claustrophobic and insecure, to be honest, it brought a lot of tension and changed my perspective more than once.I loved how the story was divided between the two points of view. Both of them were in the first person but I've never had a problem to see who's speaking. Duh, the chapters did have titles with the name of the characters! I also liked the way both stories were interwoven and how quickly and effortlessly they picked up when the other has just finished. Really, as the chapters flip back and forth the similarities between the women and their lives started to feel suspicious and somehow creepy, and it was obvious that eventually I'll start to suspect Edward as well.I think the characters there are not created to be liked by the readers. Their decisions didn't help to warm to them, and it is not that I had problems with the characters but I did think that both the women, Emma and Jane, were incredibly naive. There were thousands of warning bells that they chose to ignore and the way they meekly agreed to be controlled by both house and Edward was remarkable and odd. I mean, allowing a man to control your diet and exercise? No, thank you. It was even more surprising that they were like lambs because they were both relatively troubled women and they should know better.The house on One Folgate was like a living and breathing character itself, to be honest. I really started to believe that the house is trying to destroy the ones it doesn't approve of, that it controls the lives. It was truly extraordinary how the author managed to create this special, claustrophobic atmosphere of this place.It is not a book that is destined to make you scared or look over your shoulder. It is a book that is destined to make you feel tension and suspense, keep you in the dark and play with your mind. It is a slow burner, this novel, but with this kind of book it shouldn't be different - well, you can't expect the biggest twist to be explained on the first pages, right. No, you're expecting it to grow slowly in tension, to change tracks, to pull wool over your eyes, and \"The Girl Before\" just does it. However, as the circle of suspects was very limited in the novel, the end didn't come as such a BIG surprise, although the last quarter of the story truly meddled with my mind and made me change my opinion about some characters.Because of the slow pace it takes some time for the book to really pick up, and it happens when Jane discovers that someone died in the house before, and it also takes time for Emma to start to feel afraid. However, even with it taking time, for me it was engaging, interesting and unusual read. The way the story developed was very masterfully and skilfully plotted and organized and I absolutely admired this feeling of dread that the author smuggled onto the pages.This is a story about secrets, lies and appearances that can often be deceiving. It is one huge rollercoaster ride full of ups and downs and there was something very special in it and I didn't want to put it down. It is an engrossing mystery, even if the characters are not too likeable - but they don't have to be in this kind of story. It is good enough that they are multi - layered, they are very complex and I think that no matter what, we never know if they're telling the truth or if they're hiding something. It was a thought - provoking, addictive and a clever read, multi - layered with many surprises and I highly recommend \"The Girl Before\" to you.Copy provided by the publisher in return for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.476720"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.476720"]]

But I almost think it does a disservice to the book they're trying to get me to read. So I almost avoided this. Alas, the actual description here on Netgalley was so riveting I requested it, and I'm thrilled that I did (no pun intended)! I want to read a book because YOU think it's great, not because it's just like someone else's book (I didn't even like The Girl On The Train. Rachel was far too pathetic for my taste.)Now THIS... this was an innovative spin on those other psychological novels. The house itself became a character. I actually wish that was explored more. I loved the way all of the characters developed here. (view spoiler)[ There were a couple of 'wait what?!\" moments that threw me off that I fully intended on writing here like 'why would she uh, slob his knob when the burglars forced her to do that exact thing to them? Why not just have sex. But you know... that was taken care of.My huge qualm was that the ending felt like the author was like 'Welp, why don't we just go ahead and make everyone a psycho. Even though house. He's a psycho! She's a psycho! Everyonesssss a psycho!!!! It felt a bit cop out. Also, Edward was much too precise through the book for him to just be like 'let's get rid of that and make a new one of our own' about the baby. The way it was written he sounded like a child having a tantrum and it was disappointing to see his character make that jump.Then when she said she had a surprise of her own... that she had planned the baby. No. What? No! (that was me when i read that) I thought she was going to say the baby didn't have downs and she was just testing him. If it was part of her plan it should have been something the reader was aware of. There were enough surprises at the end that it would have served us readers better. WE would have wanted to believe Edward was good when she was trying to find out who killed Emma. We would have been championing him WITH her and even MORE torn about him being the possible killer.That being said, it was still a great and riveting book. And the ending happened so quickly that I can forget it and just act like it ended my way. LOL!

When you’re comparing a novel to those, you have big shoes to fill, and anything less feels like a disappointment.The only similarities between these novels are the overall tone and the twist, but in The Girl Before, it’s a predictable twist.

I'm also excited to learn there will be a movie adaptation coming out, directed by Ron Howard, which is impressive in its own right especially considering the book won't be officially released until next month so apparently someone has faith in its success and I don't disagree. The Girl Before was a fast-paced, psychological, thriller that alternates point of view and narration between Jane Cavendish, in present tense, and Emma Matthews, a previous resident of the house Jane is now renting who died tragically at the residence under suspicious circumstances. Both women find common ground at One Folegate Street, an architectural wonder, designed, owned and dictated by Edward Monkford but aside from that and their striking physical resemblance the two women have little in common. Emma is deceitful and manipulative and dishonest to the core, where Jane is good hearted and well meaning, trying to recover from a recent still birth and uncover the history of the home she now lives in and the mysterious deaths of several of its former inhabitants. The home itself comes with many rules and regulations that the renter must agree to and follow under strict supervision of Edward Monkford. In a way this reminds me loosely of Fifty Shades of Grey even though I didn't like the Fifty Shades Trilogy at all and I thorough enjoyed The Girl Before, however there were definitely similarities. The dynamic between Edward and the women in his life for one, his narcissistic personality, his obsessive compulsive tendencies and need for absolute control, to name a few. I really liked the contrast between Jane and Emma. J.P. Delaney did a great job creating realistic, three dimensional characters and I found it was easy to become invested in them because they were so real, despite their character flaws. This was an ending that I didn't see coming, in more than one way actually, and that's something that I considered absolutely necessary in a good thriller. I will say that I found myself a bit disappointed at the very end. (view spoiler)[**spoiler alert** I don't want to say too much but I personally wasn't pleased with the choice Jane made at the very end. Perhaps it was the noble thing to do, however, if Edward had given me the same choice if I were in Jane's shoes I am quite confident I would have gone in the opposite direction then Jane went and I was hoping she'd do the same. I don't want to give to much away so I'll leave it at that.I read a lot of books from this genre and I can honestly say this one can hold its own amongst the vast competition out there and I'd definitely recommend it and look forward to seeing the movie version when it comes out.

Are you good enough for the house? What sacrifices can you make if you want to live here?

No things on the floor, no pictures on the wall, no pets, no kids, no curtains, no rugs, and much more. The house should always be open to tours and architects, and you will be required to submit to impromptu questions about yourself or certain parts of the electrical system will shut down.

Emma seems similar to Jane, which sends Jane on a mission to find out what happened. he mysterious death is just the beginning.This was a really quick read for me. I found myself really liking both Emma and Jane. There were pretty similar sounding at first, but as the story went on things changed. Neither of these girls is really likeable, although I did feel really sorry for Jane. The love interest for both of these women was horrible.

He would have had to be more than just good-looking to be worth all the trouble.The house has some really cool features and I loved learning about them all. An app on your phone can control the house, which is nothing really new. This house also learns from you and will remember things like what temperature you like the water in the shower to be. This house, through the app, can also tell you if you need to pick up more milk or eggs, since it can sense what is in your fridge. While all that sounds cool, I was left thinking about what a violation of privacy not having curtains, and almost certainly having cameras in the house would be.The twists were okay for me. The pacing of this story was excellent until about 60% where the characters started to show their true colors and the story started to unravel for me. It didn’t go anywhere near where I expected it. I hated almost everyone by the end of the story and felt certain the house was indeed cursed.In brighter news, I heard this was to be made into a movie directed by Ron Howard.

The character from the past is Emma. From the present, we have Jane. They have a lot in common, and it starts with them renting a house. The house is very unique. It is austere, and there is a very long list of rules that you must agree to in order to live there.Both of the girls end up in a relationship with the architect, Edward. As we weave through both of their stories, we see that their relationships are very much the same, following the same patterns as Edward asserts his dominance.Emma has a violent past. She was attacked in her old apartment where she lived with her boyfriend, Simon. They move into the new house to help Emma get over it. She and Simon soon break up.Jane's past involves a still-born daughter. She is also trying to heal. Jane finds out that Emma died in this house, and becomes somewhat obsessed with finding out how.They both find out that Edward's wife and daughter were killed while the house was being built and are forever interred in the foundation.The Girl Before is a weird story. This house is very high-tech. And between that and the rules, it seems to change the personalities of the people who live there. It's hard to explain without your reading it, and I don't want to spoil too much.Ultimately, it's a mystery about just what happened to Emma, as well as Edward's family. But the journey to these answers is very entertaining.I found the lack of quotation marks annoying. And even more annoying is at some points Delaney uses them, and then other times not. It had to do with which character was talking, but it was hard for me to adjust back and forth. I didn't see a need for this technique. In other books like this, I eventually got used to it, but with The Girl Before, it kept switching back and forth.While I was suitably surprised by the outcome, I still felt the ending needed some more punch. I was expecting a weird, exciting twist, and I just didn't get it. I would still recommend The Girl Before. I found it easy to read and very engaging. I'm not sure I would recommend this to most teens because of the sexual situations; it's definitely an adult book.Added note: the Amazon entry for this book says it's soon to be a motion picture directed by Ron Howard.

The story is told from each woman's point of view, with Emma's story being 'Then', and Jane's story being 'Now'. Emma and Jane both end up choosing to live in the same house, located at One Folgate Street. They had to jump through some unusual hoops in order to live there, however.Prior to being approved, anyone interested in living in the starkly minimalist house is required to fill out a form with some rather odd questions, and agree to live by a set of 200 rules, which includes having no books, photos, throw pillows, or anything else that is considered 'clutter' in the house. They must also include a photo of themselves, something each woman thought odd.The architect and owner of the house is a man named Edward, who originally built the house for his family. After losing his wife and son, Edward never lived there, choosing instead to rent it out for an extremely low price to anyone who was willing to live by his stringent demands.Both women become involved with Edward, and when Jane finds out that Emma—whom she closely resembles—died in the house, she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her. Was it truly an accident, or something more sinister that killed Emma? Was Edward involved? Despite being warned against it, Jane is relentless in her search for the truth, never realizing she was putting herself in danger... until it was too late.The Girl Before is a deliciously creepy psychological thriller worthy of the genre. I devoured it in a single day... I just couldn't put it down until I knew who did what, and why. There were several surprises along the way, but the last one left me so stunned, you could have knocked me over with a feather. I'm not kidding. My jaw hit the floor and I kept shaking my head in disbelief because (and I know I say this a lot) I NEVER saw it coming.Treat yourself and get a copy of this book when it hits the shelves.

(Yeah I know its a bit of a cliché) But it was true.The book is divided into two stories that ultimately involve the same house 1, Folgate Street. It tells the story of Emma who was a previous tenant and her chapters are titled Then : Emma and the current tenant Jane and her chapters are titled Now : Jane. Both their stories revolve around an enigmatic architect called Edward Monkford who has somewhat of a tragic history.Edward Monkford designed 1, Folgate Street which is the cutting edge in minimalistic living and unobtrusive technology. He has a lot of rules (at least 200) for whatever successful applicant he lets out his house to. Some of the ideas for the house are actually quite amazing but how long before an occupant would start to feel the sterile walls start to close in around them? This part of the point of the story, to have next to no personal possessions apart from the absolute essential and have the house with its own computerised system called Housekeeper. (Which is monitored by Edward) Nothing is private.Emma and Jane are two very different people who have both been through trauma and although their stories are told in the present and the past they feel like they are running together. There are divides between their chapters that ask questions with multiple choice or agree/disagree that are subjected to the tenants but can also make you think what would you do?There is a mystery surrounding what happened to Emma that Jane is determined to get to the bottom of as well as trying to find out what makes Edward tick as they start a relationship of sorts. There is much manipulation going on within the pages from most of the people in book so at times it is hard to feel sympathy for everyone as more and more is revealed. There are dark deeds at work and not everything is as it seems, which is good to have at the heart of a mysterious thriller, after all!

You have two parallel stories, both from the point of view of a different young woman. One has lost a baby at full term in a terrible birth story that I found very moving, the other has been badly mentally damaged by being the victim of a home invasion. They both at different times live in a house which is austere, minimalistic and which demands a great deal of sacrifice by those who live there. You must pass a complicated test, take regular re-testing and allow architecture students access to the house. There is a mystery surrounding the house, rumours that there was a terrible accident involving the architect's wife and that she died on the premises. The architect is an enigma, compellingly attractive but also complicated and apparently very available! The house has secrets, the architect has secrets, everyone is unreliable, nobody can be trusted.If you analysed this from a feminist perspective this is a book about abuse in lots of forms, it is a book full of characters who should have known better, who behave badly and who are a bit pathetic. I had annoyances in how the author portrayed the women, I looked up to see if this was written by a man or a woman, turns out this is a pseudonym for a man, colour me unsurprised! No woman would have written these women this way. But when you are reading it and you suspend your disbelief and cynical eye, it is a really good read. It is pacy and compelling.

The chapters alternate between Emma and Jane, past and present. Each of these young women are willing \"audition\" to rent a clinically beautiful and technologically advanced house by a famous minimalist architect. First comes a long questionnaire of odd and personal questions. Each young woman fills out the questionnaire which also requires three photos. Hmmmm. The weird questions and the photo requirement didn't set off any warning bells? If Edward Monkhouse, the architect and owner, likes the responses, then he grants an interview to decide who is appropriate for the house. Of course, both Emma and Jane get an interview. There are rules--lots of them: no books, no rugs, no personal effects, no photos, no clutter. A computer \"housekeeper\" monitors everything in the house. Both Emma and Jane are unreliable narrators and willing to surrender their personalities to fit the house and the architect. I have a thing about people who give up everything to satisfy another person or ideological belief. I know it happens, but it is almost impossible for me to imagine. It is one thing for it to happen gradually as in a Stockholm Syndrome situation or a domestic situation that develops over time as a matter of gradual reconditioning, but for an eager almost immediate surrender to someone else's dictates?

Delaney. Though lured by a strong synopsis that promised a solid mystery, I knew I was in trouble with this book early on, simply because I didn’t buy the main premise of the story. Even bearing in mind the crazy cost of London rentals, I just don’t believe that anyone would want to live at cut-price One Folgate Street, no matter how futuristically ground-breaking its design might be. Why? Because to live here pretty much means signing your whole life, including all of your possessions, away. It also means signing a contract that contains more than two-hundred clauses (I’m not exaggerating), thanks to a landlord who is, to put it mildly, a complete control freak.The landlord in question is Edward Monkford, the renowned architect who designed One Folgate Street, and now rents it out to a very select few tenants. Jane is one of these tenants, as was Emma, the ‘girl before’ of the title. The Girl Before employs a dual timeline, and it soon becomes clear that both Jane and Emma’s time at One Folgate Street follows eerily similar patterns, including the fact that both women inexplicably start to fall for the utterly charmless Monkford. The catch? Monkford has a dark side. He also has a past. The other catch? Emma didn’t leave One Folgate Street alive – she left in a body bag. Will Jane escape the clutches of One Folgate Street before it’s too late? Will she say ‘screw it’ to all those clauses in her contract, and run? She really should.An instant bestseller with a movie in the works, The Girl Before was also recently named ‘Thriller of the Month’ by The Sunday Times.

Although, I have never heard of the author J.P. Delaney this book is going to be the most talked about book in 2017 when it hits the shelves and stores around the world. This story is told from alternate POVs which I've absolutely come to love in books. We are being told a story from \"Before Emma\", a previous occupant in yet a very unconventional but architecural marvel, who once suffered from a home break in and has come to this home for safety. Next we have \"Now Jane\", the current occupant, who was lead her to forget her past and her personal tragedy. Both are trying to escape their past, while seeing their journey parallel to one another and both fall and begin relationship with the owner of this crazy amazing home. Which by the way the home itself could be another fascinating character in the story. Well that's a glimpse of what's to come if you read this book. You'll be guessing until the end.

The idea, he claims, is that people can be changed by this state-of-the art dwelling and minimalist living style. The narration alternates between Emma (THEN) and Jane (NOW). Each has her own personality and both have recently experienced an event that has left them vulnerable and weakened. Now they become obsessed by the house, the architect, and those that lived there before -- especially when it seems that death has visited. The characters have a lot of depth and the chapters are short so the book moves very fast. Manipulation, deception, and suspicion lead to only one end.Ignore the fact that these books of psycho drama featuring women are now always compared to those titles I will not name, but you know what I mean. There is a lot of hype about this novel, and it is definitely one all fans of this genre should read. The author is writing under a pseudonym and you can tell it's not a debut work.Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine for the e-book ARC to review.

There should be suspense but for me the flip flopping each paragraph between women made it hard for me to connect with either of them. I think I would've liked a bit more time on each character before swapping over in paragraphsI also found the minimalist rules hard to swallow. Conditions of being able to rent mean these women have to give up all their possessions and follow a series of rules set out by the creepy architect of the house who may or may not have killed his wife and buried her under the patio. I understand the need for a fresh start but how about a bit of de-cluttering instead??The language is sparse, designed to suit the house and minimalist ideas giving you a quick read. I do actually like the design of the house as I could picture it with everything having it's place but I'm not signing a lease that bars me from cushions to keep the aesthetic.

A pacy read, it alternates between the viewpoints of two women, one before and one after. The plot centres around a house that first Emma and subsequently Jane have signed up to live in, despite a hefty set of unusual rules, and an owner who may not be quite what he seems. It kept me interested and was a quick, easy read, with some good shock moments peppered throughout, and the obligatory 'twist' at the end. Overall, however, it wasn't outstanding. I didn't really care for either of the main characters, or anyone else in the book for that matter, but then in all of the thrillers I have read in this vein, that has been the case. It is a light, entertaining read probably suited to fans of the other big players in this sub-genre (Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train etc. etc.) but aside from one or two well written creepy moments, it won't be one you can't stop thinking about. I do feel it could have been elevated to provide a higher shock factor if Jane had made a different decision towards the end of the book, and indeed this lack of decision is the only element that has stayed with me after finishing reading. I hear it has been picked up for a film version, and it reads like it was written with just that intention.

I'm not sure about the comparisons to Gone Girl, because this book doesn't have time for the intense character development of that book, because it has more characters, one being a very cool, and yet disturbing house.  This book goes back and forth in time, alternating between two women who both rent a cutting edge 'smart house' from a mysterious architect who interviews new residents and gives them a set of rules.  These rules are not just the 'no pets-no-kids' type rules--more like a 'lifestyle' set of rules with questionnaires popping up periodically that cause the 'smart house' to shut down all amenities until the questions are answered.  A bit over-bearing, just like the landlord, a handsome, mysterious award winning architect who believes that our living spaces should change and define us.  Now you get a sense of the weirdness of the house, and it's builder so it's on to two very damaged women who live in the house at different times. One, who's had her previous apartment burglarized, and the other woman who's had a stillborn child's.  The plot moves back and forth between the two women as we learned what really happened. Since this is a thriller, I don't want to give anything away.  Just have fun reading and trying to guess 'who done it'.

Slabs of pale stone, expansive plate glass, soaring ceilings, tile floors, a stairway with no railing.  An app controls lighting, shower pressure and internet access. There already have been three deaths at the site.  Maybe another one soon?Edward Monkford, the owner and architect, rents the austere structure at a bargain price, but there are stipulations.  No clutter of any sort.  Compliance is monitored by sensors and cameras.  An applicant is interviewed by the sleek owner and fills out a long questionnaire, which begins: “Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.”The story is told in alternating chapters by Jane, the new tenant, and Emma, “the girl before.”  They look alike.  Both are recovering from traumas.  Both become involved with Edward.  Jane learns that Emma died in a fall from the unguarded stairs and that Edward’s wife and young son were killed in an accident during construction at the site.  According to Emma’s therapist, Jane is in danger.  From Edward?  Will Jane become the next  girl before?”  We find out at the violent climax.I hesitated to pick up another book with “girl” in the title, having read “Gone Girl,” “The Girl on the Train” and others.  But I’m glad I did.  This “girl” book is as meticulously constructed as the sleek house.An afterward tells the reader that JP (no period after either initial) Delaney is the pseudonym of a bestselling writer.  A movie version of the book is to be directed by Ron Howard.

You can't have anything on the floors or counters for example.I couldn't quite understand why either of these women wanted that house so badly.  They have to complete a lengthy questionnaire on their values, submit to an interview, and provide three photos.  It is framed as a social experiment.And then every now and then the Housekeeping program sends more questions and until the occupant answers them, certain functions of the house are shut down.The story is cleverly told and for a while the reader can't tell if the  girl before  is Emma or Jane.  I don't usually like alternating chapter voices, but this is well done.As the story unfolds, the reader learns more about Emma and Jane.  Neither has been quite honest.I'm not usually able to guess who  did it  but I did in this case.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jan 20, 2017"], ["review_text", "\n  \"Yes, daddy. Yes.\"\nNo. Please no. I feel like somebody noted the success of books like Gone Girl and the success of Fifty Shades of Grey and thought: wouldn't it be great if we had a book that combined the two? No, actually. No, it wouldn't.The Girl Before failed on so many levels, and I say that as a reluctant fan of these \"domestic thrillers\". I've enjoyed everything from The Girl on the Train to last year's ridiculous but fast-paced Behind Closed Doors. I expected I'd like this one too, but all I got was a weird relationship with \"rules\", another guy called Edward, and transparent twists.The book alternates between the perspectives of Emma (Before) and Jane (After) as they move into the techno-minimalist apartment at One Folgate Street. Though beautiful, there is almost no furniture, absolutely everything is digital, and most bizarre of all - the landlord and famous architect, Edward Monkford, requires that his tenants follow some very strict rules. Both women soon find themselves caught up in a love affair with Edward, but when Jane discovers that Emma died in the apartment, she can't help investigating further.Jane's digging uncovers some disturbing facts about Emma - she expressed concern over Edward's controlling ways to her psychiatrist, her death may not have been an accident, and strangest of all, she looked eerily like Jane herself.Firstly, I don't know what is wrong with these women. Without giving away twists, their behaviour is often outright ridiculous. Warning bells are going off left, right and centre, and they're completely oblivious. At worst, Edward is a murderer, but even at best, he's a creepy weirdo. It's almost comical how much he resembles Christian Grey - not just sexually dominant and prone to \"losing control\" but also strict about Emma and Jane's eating and exercise habits. Ick. Get out. Also, lots of people have a \"type\", but it's just plain weird if your \"type\" are all women who look virtually identical. Secondly, there is no atmosphere. I feel like the author tried to create a \"creepy house with a dark history\" feeling, but it didn't come through because so much of the book was nothing more than a weird romance. I also see how Delaney was trying to create a \"ghost of past lovers\" vibe, but this ain't no Daphne du Maurier. The writing wasn't strong enough to make you scared for the characters, to keep you metaphorically looking over your shoulder.It is often really difficult to distinguish between the two perspectives. I had to keep flicking to the beginning of the chapter to find out whether I was on Emma or Jane. This is partly because the style is impersonal and doesn't deeply connect you with the characters, but also partly because their stories are very similar. As we soon see, Edward takes them to the same places, gives them the same food, treats them the same ways - it was like reading the same perspective twice.And there's a whole bunch of subtle racism going on, as well as a bunch of other distasteful issues. If you insist on only writing about white, middle class people, don’t make the criminals/rapists black and working class. How do you not see what's wrong with that? And casual comments like this (made by a psychiatrist): \"In any relationship there are two repetition compulsions at work - his and hers.\" I can think of a whole lot of relationships where that definitely isn't true.Plus, there's a really poor and insensitive use of rape as a plot device. Without giving away spoilers, someone who was seen to be orally raped is then making jokes about preferring human sperm sacs (to fish sperm sacs - it's a long story, Japanese restaurant, blah blah). Firstly... gross. And secondly... gross.But maybe, even after all of this, I could have been persuaded to up my rating if the ending had provided us with an interesting and satisfying reveal. Unfortunately, I saw it coming from a mile away. The list of suspects is too short; the list of suspects who we'd actually care about it being is even shorter. I'm sorry, but I can't even find anything good to say about it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.748067"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.748067"]]

Is this madness ever going to end? Why can’t a book be left to stand on it’s own merits? I guess it’s my fault for giving in and picking up yet another ‘Girl’ book. Have no fear though, once again, I’ve landed in the minority, as the reviews I’ve seen have been overwhelming positive and apparently it’s being made into a movie. So, take this review with a grain of salt. It’s just one reader’s thoughts and feelings, after all.Point blank - I don’t get it. This whole scenario is strange. Odd. Completely ridiculous. What sane person would agree to live in this situation? Forget sane - why would anybody sign up for this?Maybe I’m the crazy one, but there is no way I would ever agree to give up most of my belongings to move in to a minimalistic stone box of a house that comes with over 200 stipulations. Restrictive and ridiculous rules. Not to mention, answering a bizarre questionnaire and having my “amenities” shut down every time the perfectionistic control freak of a landlord feels like I need to answer yet another series of questions. All in an effort to gauge my “growth” or acceptance of the lifestyle the house demands. I don’t care how good looking or how famous of an architect the owner is; I wouldn’t do it. The author sells the idea by garnering sympathy from the reader for the two women and the excitement of top of the line technology - it's the ultimate smart house. Both women have recently experienced tragedies and need a fresh start. And, of course, the rent for this pseudo stone cell is quite cheap. Hmm . . . I wonder why?The story unfolds through the eyes of the two women - Emma, the previous tenant, and Jane, the current tenant. The story flip-flops between then and now, which takes place two years apart, at a pretty rapid pace. We get to see how their stories mirror each other and it’s a little convoluted at times. More than once, I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose head I was in because I was kind of lost. I liked the whole notion of getting caught up in a story or your past and recreating or reliving that same story over and over. But that’s were the likes kind of ended for me.The entire plot felt like a tangled mess and not one I particularly enjoyed unraveling. Albeit, there was something about it that kept me turning the pages. I can’t say I was wowed though - not by the characters, the scenario or even the twist. I failed to see what so many others have found exceptional about this one.*THANK YOU to Random House/Ballantine Books and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.751715"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.751715"]]

The movie rights have even been sold to Universal with Ron Howard to direct. I didn't know any of that when I first read the description for the book. I just thought it sounded like an entertaining read.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"One Folgate Street in London, is a high-tech minimalist house with so many cool amenities and features that you would figure the rent would be sky-high. But the rent is actually very reasonable.So what's the catch? Well there's no catch really...Except for THE RULES!!Tenants are required to follow very a list of very strict rules. Things like no pets, paying rent on time, no loud noise after 11pm, take out the garbage. You know, things like that...NOPE...not at all like that.There are over 200 rules that tenants MUST be abide by in order to live in the house.To say that the owner/landlord of One Folgate Street is picky about who lives in the house is an understatement. To say that he's a bit particular about his rules for the tenants is putting it mildly. The rental application is extremely long and includes many bizarre (and impossible) questions.\"A person close to you confesses in confidence that they ran someone over while drunk. As a result they have given up drinking for good. Would you feel obliged to report it to the police?\"Is it worth it to live in such a beautiful high-tech home? This home with its awesome hidden gadgets. A house cleaner comes weekly. The lights, heat and cooling will set to tenants personal preferences. The shower will also adjust to their personal settings. Even the air in the house makes you feel better with its ultrasonic - mood enhancing waveforms.\"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary.\"Just don't forget.....the RULES. The main one? NO CLUTTER! Everything has its place, usually out of sight. So no pictures, no plants, no ornaments, no books....wait NO BOOKS???? (OMG!!! that's just wrong!)The owner, Edward Monkford is the architect who built the house. He also lives a minimalist lifestyle. He will not rent unless he finds the perfect tenant. But his need for control goes so much farther than that. And yet... some people are drawn to the \"tormented genius\". But who is Edward really? What happens if someone does break the rules?Emma and her boyfriend, Simon are looking for a safe place to live after a recent break-in. However, their budget is a bit tight and everything is either horrible or too expensive. Then the agent shows them One Folgate Street. She explains the lengthy process for application. Simon is hesitant but Emma feels like the place might be exactly what they need. The rules make her feel secure. She wants to reinvent herself, bring order to her life, to change and be a better person.The house may change her, but will it be for the better?We then meet Jane. After a devastating loss, Jane is looking for new place to live. She wants to make a new start and hopes that One Folgate Street is the place to do it. But it's not long before some strange things start happening. Jane learns some of the dark history of the house and is determined to find out more, especially what happened to the previous tenant.The house may be inexpensive and full of high-tech gadgets, but the walls of the house are also full of secrets. Where is the previous tenant? and is Jane in any danger?\"That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\"This book may not be for everyone. There is a lot of sex. I will definitely say that some of the characters \"turn-ons\" may be \"turn-offs\" for some readers. It wasn't really my thing and I could have done without those parts. However, it didn't really interfere with my enjoyment of the rest of the book.The chapters alternate between THEN and NOW and are narrated by Jane (NOW) and Emma (THEN). I flew through the pages. Occasionally I had to flip back to double-check whether it was Emma or Jane but most of the time I was able to keep up. The story may have been hard to believe and far-fetched at times, but I decided to try to go with the flow and enjoy it...In the end I really liked this novel. I was pulled and it got right inside my head. I had to know what was going to happen! A thrilling story about a house I would NEVER want to live in, (seriously I could not handle any of the rules) but I sure enjoyed reading about it.P.S Put your shampoo awayThank you, Ballantine Books for providing an advanced copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.755195"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.755195"]]

It is an example of extreme minimalism and incorporates the latest home technology. It was originally designed by the techno-architect Edward Monkton as his family home but his wife and son died there which means its now available for others to live. Only there is the slight problem of over 200 conditions that have to be adhered to by whoever lives there. And they have to be interviewed and approved by Monkton personally. The narrative focuses on Emma from the past, and Jane in the present. Both are troubled women. Emma was held at knife point by burglars and she is struggling to come to terms with this. This event drives her decision to apply to live in the house, despite her boyfriend, Simon's reservations. The conditions for residing there will turn her into a new person with more control, Jane has had a stillborn baby and grieving. This house will be her new start and she just happens to fancy the architect. She is receiving a flower delivery of gentians which she assumes is from the architect until she reads the card....and realises there is more to the house than she thought. Emma died in the house.A concerned Jane begins to investigate Emma, the girl before to ascertain whether she was murdered, and if so by whom. There are uncomfortable similarities between her and Emma. From both resembling Edward's wife, to having a no strings attached affair with him which runs a similar if not identical course, to both having risque sex. Jane meets the people in Emma's life including Simon, the aggrieved boyfriend, and Carol, the therapist. Meanwhile, the house appears to develop an entity of its own as strange and random things happen. Is the controlling and manipulative Edward a killer? Is Emma a reliable narrator? An air of menace hangs over the house as danger begins to close in around Jane. The writing is lucid, sparse and beautiful. Pretty much like the house, and there is an air of claustrophobia in the story. This is a house with tragic beginnings and a strong character that is destined to trouble those who live there, you can just feel this. It is a good psychological thriller that keeps you reading without ever losing interest.

The perfect house will help people reach levels of perfection they never thought they could achieve. This is the house located on One Folgate Street. The Girl Before tells the stories of Emma and Jane, two occupants who lived in One Folgate.. Emma died under mysterious circumstances while living in One Folgate Street, and Jane is the current occupant. Both women look alike, and both were involved with Edward Monkton, the architect and mastermind behind One Folgate Street--both also happen to bear an eerie resemblance to Edward’s deceased wife. Jane begins to investigate Emma’s death, and by doing so, puts herself in danger.While the premise was interesting, it felt like the author was trying to cram pieces into a puzzle that didn’t fit. As a result, everything unraveled and it all became a little ridiculous.

And that wheel keeps turning and turning throughout the entire story. Some days that wheel grinds in the down and dirty. Some days it revs up speed and gains relentless traction.Emma Matthews lives in the \"once upon a gruesome time\". Her spin in the wheel is entitled \"Then\". Emma and her boyfriend, Simon, are desperate for a safe haven after Emma is attacked in their present apartment. Fear makes you snap at quick decisions. Desperately, they apply for residency at a slick, state-of-the-art building. Even all the mind-blowing questionaires and restrictions don't deter them. No books (Ah, c'mon now!), no cushions, no placemats, no personal items left out. And they sign on the dotted line.Edward is the award winning architect and owner of this granite luxury edifice. He lost his wife and young son in a freak accident not long before. Living in Japan for a time afterwards, Edward returns to manage his property. And manage he does......quite to the nth degree.Jane Cavendish resides in the time slot entitled \"Now\". She will be the latest occupant of One Folgate Street. She recently gave birth to a stillborn little girl and has been devastated by the loss. Jane, too, is seeking solace behind the walls of this highly efficient building. Although this \"covenant\" seems highly imposing and limiting, Jane signs on the dotted line as well.Soon Jane begins to connect occurrences in her present situation to those of Emma in the past. Things just don't seem to add up. What actually happened to Emma?The Girl Before will be made into a movie by Ron Howard. It brings to mind a Julia Roberts movie (1991) called Sleeping With the Enemy. Remember how the canned goods and spices had to be stacked just so and the towels primly arranged on the rack? Oh, sweetheart, this is just the beginning......The Girl Before is one sharp-ended story that reaches deeply into the slightly tilted minds of its characters.

A thriller has not made me this excited since Megan Miranda's All the Missing Girls. The story is told in alternating chapters between Emma, the girl before, and Jane, the current tenant of a very unique flat. While both women are searching for a living situation within their budgets in expensive London, their brokers both mention a possible solution. One Folgate Street has been designed by an architectural genius, Edward Monkford, but in order to live there, one must pass a series of vetting including a multi paged questionnaire and interview. This is where things just begin to get weird. I fear saying much more will give away the twists and turns within these pages. (As an aside, Emma's chapters are told without any quotation marks in the dialogue. While it takes some time to getting used to, it is very effective in differentiating between the two women's chapters. However I am completely curious as to why the author chose to use this device, if anyone knows, fill me in.)I thoroughly enjoyed how the author portrayed One Folgate - the apartment itself takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story. There are multiple triggers within this book. I feel if I mention them here, they would be spoilers. So. Pretty much, if it's a trigger you can think of, it's here.

Then there are the other rules - hundreds of them, seemingly waiting to trip you up, catch you unawares. There are also regular questions to answer, very personal and intrusive questions.

She soon discovers that Emma met an untimely death in the house, and begins investigating just what really happened there.The narrative certainly kept my attention, I really wanted to know what happened to Emma, but I found it hard to believe in Edward, AND his rules, so really that stopped me from rating this one any higher.*Thank you to Netgalley amp; Quercus for my ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.793349"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.793349"]]

By ‘‘manipulative,’’ I mean you’re more than pushed into liking specific characters and disliking others. So you do that. But despite having your thoughts about characters shaped by the author, you’re still manipulated some more as the story progresses. I don’t exactly like when that happens. I prefer to be exposed to all facets of someone’s personality and then be able to decide for myself who deserves justice and who doesn’t. This mystery novel is engrossing, despite it not giving us the liberty of making our own opinions on the protagonists and antagonists until the very end. The short chapters surely had their role to play in my being unable to put this book down.It’s slow, partly because it’s a mystery novel. If you’re familiar with the genre, you know that these types of novels take time to pick up because it’s all about the building part. It takes time for Jane to discover someone died in the house and it takes time for Emma to feel scared. That’s when things really become interesting.The death thing confused me, since I thought real estate agents were supposed to disclose info like that – especially when the previous tenants have died. But I guess there are places where no such law exists. Bummer, but it worked in the author’s favour. I enjoyed seeing this book shift from mystery to psychological thriller. I’m definitely the type to enjoy action in my plots, so I couldn’t do anything else but welcome the darker side of THE GIRL BEFORE, even if it takes time to reach that point. The characters also take time to become important in the reader’s eyes; most likely because they seem so normal, but that’s probably done on purpose to give the effect that this kind of story could happen to you or me. Anyone at all. But don’t worry; it’s very, very unlikely. Sleep tight now.

It was built by a techno-minimalist architect named Edward Monkford. There is an intense 200-question application, a face-to-face interview with the ones Edward personally approves, and even then..they rarely get the lease. And if you do, you have to live by strict rules and adapt to this minimalist lifestyle. It is all in the contract. Things like no children or pets, no curtains or rugs, everything must be put away at all times (including dishes, clothes, etc), no books, nothing left out on floors, no flatbed furniture, etc. Plus you’re required to keep the same cleaning service on, must open the house to visitors for architecture tours, and must take assessments every month to see how you change throughout your stay at One Folgate Street.Not my cup of tea to live under such a strict lifestyle. The two women in this story both went through a trauma before needing to find somewhere new to live on a budget. And One Folgate Street is a house that allows for people to live beyond their means (in terms of rent). Emma and Simon recently had a break in, so Emma needs to feel safe. Emma is the girl from then.And Jane’s chapters are marked now. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is reeling from the loss. For Jane the house feels like it could be a fresh start.

I’m just looking at how it worked into the plot and some scenes felt like added length as they added nothing to the story.The ending felt somewhat tame, though it was still satisfying. I guess it wasn’t as explosive as I was hoping. I liked the random application questions that were thrown in the story sporadically.

The sampler measured in as 17% of the total book, which is quite lengthy portion and definitely had my intrigue piqued. There are so many physiological thrillers available today that sell themselves as in the style of Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins. Very few actually come close to living up to the powerhouses in this genre. This book, however, deserves to sit beside them. This dark and brooding tale was alive with emotion and drew the reader into the tension of the tale. The story wasn't set out in chronological order and this provided room for the tale to slowly unfurl, and share its secrets with the reader at its own pace. The telling of the tale, as well as the setting of it, were as alive as the characters, and all three worked together to provide something suspenseful, shocking and totally unique!First ReadingI received this in exchange for an honest review from NetGalley. Thank you to the author, J.P. Delaney, and the publisher, Ballantine Books, for this opportunity.I have never read a sample of a book before and, to be honest, have never been interested in doing so. When I received an email proclaiming that I was eligible for a portion of this book I downloaded it to my Kindle without any real idea of when or if I would get to it. One day, however, I found myself short of time and eager for a quick read to finish, which is how I ended picking this up.I was hooked from the very first page! This sample contains a considerable quantity of the book, containing approximately twenty short chapters, and I flew through all of it in one sitting.Told from the split perspectives of Emma, in the past, and Jane, in the present, this chronicles the similar paths both their lives took once they became the occupant of the infamous 1 Folgate Street. Designed by cutting-edge architect, Edward Monketon, this house is unlike any other. And Monketon requires his tenants to live their life unlike any other, as well.This is the absolute definition of spine-tingling! This managed to make a modern house, full of straight lines and futuristic technology feel like a chilling, Gothic mansion, full of shadowed corners and ghosts of homeowners past. And all without dwelling on any of the melodrama associated with that genre.The no-nonsense style of writing mirrors the architect of the house and becomes just as much a function of the tale as the characters and the setting.I am so eager to uncover the mysteries concerning this unique and compelling thriller and can't wait until I can get the rest of the book in my hands!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.806500"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.806500"]]

I’m just loving these imaginative psychological thrillers coming out recently!!While this appears to be a debut novel, this author apparently has some experience with crime writing, having written this book under a pseudonym. I wish I knew who the ‘crime writer’ is- but I suppose that’s a mystery for another day. In the meantime, I hear this book might be the basis for a movie, and Ron Howard would be the director! So, if that isn’t enough to peak your interest, I don’t know what will. While this is yet ANOTHER book for ‘fans of ‘Gone Girl’ and ‘The Girl on the Train’, and yes, it does have the requisite ‘Girl’ in the title, this book stands on its own merits and needs no other comparison.Two very different women, both having suffered emotional traumas, move in, at different times, into a very affordable, unique, technologically advanced apartment that stresses a minimalist lifestyle. The apartment’s owner screens his tenants by having them fill out a lengthy questionaire, and insists they sign a contract promising to adhere to a strict set of rules… around two hundred of them,(!!!) and if they are not obeyed there will be conseqences. The story alternates between the first person perspectives of Emma and Jane as they describe their time living in Edward Monkford’s apartment building. As the story progresses, we learn the two women bear a striking resemblance to one another, are both attracted to Edward, despite his OCD tendencies, but, Jane discovers that the previous tenant… Emma, died in the apartment, an apparent victim of suicide. Jane becomes somewhat obsessed with Emma and her backstory, while her own personal relationship with Edward begins to deepen. But, her investigation into Emma’s death could come back to haunt her….While it may seem obvious who ‘the girl before’ is, and some may guess correctly, I admit I didn’t see the twist coming and was completely surprised by the way the story developed. The suspense is low key initially, with just a mild creepy feeling permeating the sterile environment the two women live in. But, as the story develops, a feeling of dread begins to grow, and before too long, I found myself immersed in these women’s lives, wanting to send out a warning signal, to advise caution, but didn't know who or what the main threat was. The writing is superb, as the author drew me in, held my attention, managing to evoke feelings of concern for the tenants, on top of creating the feeling of foreboding and dread, that kept me turning those pages. Of the two women, one is more controversial and the other is mildly bland, and were not necessarily people I related to or felt a kinship with, but I did feel sympathy for them and worried on their behalf, despite feeling frustrated with them at times.I was slightly conflicted by the ending, which was somewhat anticlimactic, in my opinion. Other than that, I thought this was a pretty solid thriller, with a unique set up, and kept me interested from beginning to end. 4 stars"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.809920"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.809920"]]

With a list of over 200 conditions that have to be strictly adhered to by whoever lives there and a very thorough interview process for would be tenants it is proving difficult to lease. The story focuses on two troubled women who live at 1 Folgate Street, Emma from the past, and Jane in the present.For the first half of the book I was totally hooked and read the novel at every possible opportunity. It was easy to see why this book was getting so much positive attention and plans to bring to the big screen so far advanced. I was already thinking this book was going to get a high rating off me but then I don't know what exactly changed but my interest suddenly dwindled. I totally understand why other reviewers are raving about it and I am pretty sure I will watch the film when released but unfortunately I didn't find the second half of the novel anywhere as powerful as the opening.I would like to thank Net Galley and Quercus books for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.812736"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.812736"]]

Both women had some sort of superbadawful they were trying to get over when an opportunity to reside at One Folgate Street presented itself.

I mean, first of all, it had the word \"Girl\" in the title, which was a clue that it would be bandwaggoning the tail end of a trend. And then, once I finished reading it, I found Emily May's review that made the connection between this book and Fifty Shades of Grey.Here is a list of all of the things I hated about this book:1. Edward. His character was completely unconvincing. I haven't read FSoG and I have no plans to do so. However, that book has permeated the pop culture to the level that even I was able to draw the parallels between his character and Christian Grey. \"I don't do traditional relationships,\" he purred, smoothly. \"I'm coming over, and I'm going to take you to bed,\" he told her (completely out of the blue, by the way). If a man said that to me, I'd meet him at the door with a sledgehammer and a restraining order. Not that Jane would have a sledgehammer, since it's probably a violation of the preposterous rules that she agreed to before moving into the house to have a sledgehammer. 2. BDSM. Never have I been so unconvinced of spanking in a book. Never.3. BDSM. When Emma called him \"daddy\" it literally came out of nowhere. The ultimate sexual non sequitur. Where in the hell did that come from? 4. Emma. Shut your fucking face you lying liar who lies. Honestly, she was one of the most unlikeable female characters in any book ever. She lied about everything. Everything that made her sympathetic turned out to be entirely false. There were three sociopaths in this book, and she was one of them. Are we supposed to like her? I'm unclear on this point.5. Jane. She is basically the equivalent of that dumb blonde in a horror movie who hides behind the wall of whirling knives instead of running the fuck away while she can. 6. It's treatment of trauma was totally surface and entirely based on the author's idea of what some one who has experienced trauma might do. 7. The house itself was entirely creepy and no one would ever live there. People who are alive, and who are not wax statues, do things that create clutter and mess. Even the tidiest house will have, at a minimum, a family photo displayed. Living in that house would be like living in a mausoleum. No one would voluntarily live in a mausoleum before they had actually become a corpse.8. The twist. I figured it out. Go away.9. The dual narrations in opposing chapters. Tired. Trite. Been done.10. The ending. Nice gimmick.So, yeah, there really wasn't anything I liked about this book. I should've known better, really, than to buy it. But can this trend of unrealistic characters and their behaviors in \"realistic\" fiction be over now, please?

I thought I knew within the first few chapters, but I was wrong--and I'm not telling, sorry.One Folgate Street seems to be the perfect place for those wanting a decent home, yet can't afford one... but it has a strange ability to change it's residents.... The house was designed that way... with a computer system running all the facilities, and interrupting lives at the most inopportune moment, with questionnaires to answer--to see if the tenant(s) are progressing properly. This computer system, called Housekeeper had several beneficial aspects to the home owner...recognizing who was in the shower, and their water preferences, noticing the amount of REM sleep they got, checking their stress levels....and more. Two women are each searching for a place to begin again. Emma, wants security after being violently burgled. Jane has just suffered the stillbirth of a perfect child due to hospital neglect, and needs to move on after quitting her high-paying job, and more importantly, leave the constant reminders that fill her present home of poor little Isabelle. The major problem both face are the terrible price of London flats, and the horrible state of those they can afford.Enter Edward Monkford, a gorgeous, controlling perfectionist with plans* for his architecture to change the lives of those who inhabit his pristine, mausoleum like, architecture. (His idea of architecture and life had changed drastically after the tragic death of his wife and son on the grounds of the building site, but few know of the ancient Japanese ritual that also took place there....) This house is built of only the best materials and is stunningly beautiful in it's minimalism. No wonder it's won awards. The walls are smooth pale stone, all appliances and fixtures hidden from the naked eye...Usually only the rich can afford his places, so why is this place so cheap? Because there's a catch. It begins with a huge questionnaire, with numerous, often seemingly odd questions that must be answered by any prospective tenants. Once finished with that process they are then made aware of a lengthy list of rules that would make life unbearable for most, even if smitten enough with the pristine, beautiful, award winning property to sign the list of rules (including no throw pillows, personal pictures, or books, just to name a few-this house is meant to bring order, peace, and better overall health to the lives of those who live inside). There were other rights to sign over in the lengthy small-typed package, a contract that the exhausted hopeful applicants rarely had the energy left to read closely. The final request was to send three recent pictures upon submittal. There was no secret that most hopefuls are quickly rejected by email--that precious few make it through the lengthy process and acquire an interview--the last hurdle. Not until later does someone take notice of a striking resemblance the accepted tenants bear--not only to each other--but also to Edward's dead wife. All attractive, with the unusual combination of dark hair, porcelain skin, and deep blue eyes.Emma and Jane both have that advantageous resemblance, and can't believe their fortune when chosen to live in this stunning, albeit artfully sparse, masterpiece house for only a pittance. They have no idea of the plans the architect has for them, and that they have become human guinea pigs.One of the best parts of this book for me is it's POV, which is separated by chapters. We have Then: Emma, and Now: Jane. Emma had lived in the house before Jane, but ends up dead. I thought she must be the girl before. In a way she was. When Jane finds out about her, this thriller becomes a chilling mystery. As the POV's are first person, the story of Emma is a bit difficult because she is a very unreliable narrator, causing us to believe her lies, until the story unwinds enough to see who she really is. I loved the way these two stories were interwoven, one picking up quickly where the other had just left off. In no way were these hard to follow, rather the tension mounted as the reader realized there was something strange about their commonality, namely--Edward. I found it ingenious the way they fit together, and especially creepy as on some of the pages there was only a question, either from the computer check-ups, or the original form, that was particularly relevant to the situation going on. These chapter endings served to keep me engrossed in the book, feeling the need to read the next one to find out more.(view spoiler)[Emma moved in with her boyfriend Simon--who passionately loved her--after the burglary that terrified her in her old neighborhood. Most personal items were not allowed in this clean lined house (one of the MANY rules), only a few items of clothing, some toiletries. Simon was not crazy to give up his beloved possessions, but Simon loved Emma far more, so he went along with it, as he always went along with Emma, wanting to make her happy. But soon, Emma is changing, she kicks Simon out, whom she thought she needed desperately weeks before. It's then that Edward enters her life....Yet, Emma had another problem: lies. She's told them to everyone, Simon, the police, the court, and Edward. To get out of the mess some of her lies have caused, she tells more lies--about people, lies that change their lives; and when she ends up dead...no one knows where to turn....the list of suspects is incredibly long, and her case remains unsolved unsolved.When Jane moves in, she is comfortable living in the home's simplicity. It's a new start. One in which Edward also becomes entangled. Soon, she finds out about Emma, and the resemblance (as well as the story of Edward's wife). Her time is spent trying to piece together Emma's death. It's a course that leads her into danger. I loved to watch her amateur crime solving, as she meets many of the people from Emma's past; but there are far too many suspects to get her mind around. Her life becomes endangered when the true murderer gains access to her house (again...not the one I expected), and a terrifying night of hide and seek follows, with fear around every corner; the reader can't help but hold their breath as the pages turn and mysteries are solved. Can Jane overcome the murderer? Or will she end up as Emma had? Another dark haired, blue eyed girl spilling her life-blood on the immaculate stone of this house? Jane actually holds a prize...one in which we find the true meaning of who The Girl Before really is. Can she keep the prize and escape this house, alive?

I went into the book without a lot of expectations. I decided to read this book based on the summary which sounded like it had the making of a good thriller. It turns out that I was hooked by the story almost immediately and found myself doing that thing where I promise that I will read just one more chapter and before I knew it, I had read half the book. This books tells two stories from two different timelines. Emma and Jane have both lived at the house at One Folgate Street. One Folgate Street is not your average house. It is a house with rules. Lots of rules. Rules that most people wouldn't even want to try to follow. If a potential tenant decides that they want to live in the house, the approval process is quite difficult and most are turned away. Emma and Jane were both approved. Emma moved in the house first with her boyfriend, Simon. Later, Jane moves in and learns that Emma died in the house.Both Emma and Jane were going through some very troubling issues when they moved into the house and hoped the move would give them the fresh start they want. Emma and Jane were both very interesting characters. I wouldn't say that I ever really liked them but I really became invested in learning what happened to Emma and wondered what would happen to Jane. The other key character in this book, Edward, was similar in that I didn't really like his characters but I couldn't help myself from wondering what he would do next.The way this book was laid out really worked well. The chapters alternated from Emma and Jane's point of view with Jane spending a lot of energy trying to learn what had happened to Emma. Sometimes the reader would see something happen to Emma just to have it happen to Jane in the next chapter. Instead of feeling redundant, it just added an extra layer to the story. The more that Jane became obsessed with finding out about Emma the more hooked I became. This was a book that was incredibly hard to set aside.My only complaint about the book is that I am not completely sold on the ending. I do like that the book took a lot of twists and turns that I didn't expect. For some reason the ending felt like a bit of a let down for me. I think that I had expected a bigger scene to help wrap everything up. I would highly recommend this book to fans of mystery thrillers. This book grabbed my interest from the first page and never let go. I look forward to reading more from J.P.

The Gone Girl comp is painful for me. That book is my favourite of 2013, and one of my favourite books of all time; I was incredibly excited about this book, not because of that comp, but because of the interesting amp; exciting premise. Unfortunately, the result is more like 50 Shades of Grey meets a pale, brutally-murdered corpse of Gone Girl.50 Shades of Grey? Yep, there's a devilishly handsome, accomplished architect that neither of the two (lame, weak, poorly-developed) women are able to resist; there's BDSM; there's even a frigging contract. I'll tell you this, though, guys: I've had more erotic headaches than this book. Seriously, this book is so replete with awful erotica cliches, I was cringing throughout, from such golden lines as:Yes please, Daddy.Or Edward, the architect, sticking his finger up some woman's vagina in the middle of a massive society party for famous architects (or something), and causing her to go weak at the knees with the daring amp; impossibility of this all.The problem is, there's potential here - real potential. I loved the description of One Folgate Street, and a few of the set pieces, such as when Jane finds Emma's sleeping bag abandoned in a hideaway in the house. I loved the idea, and the continued ideas - especially Edward's interrogation of Jane through his \"questions.\" I thought Jane's final decision was lovely and moving, and pointed towards a wholly different, quieter, but BETTER novel lurking inside the empty, glassy shell of this one: a contemporary novel about one woman's (not two's) impossible choices, longing for a child, and conflict with the control-freak father of that child. However, this book shows, frankly, what a wonderful success Gone Girl is, and why it's been so hard to repeat (except with The Girl on the Train, which had the luxury of at least being an entirely different novel behind the \"Girl\" veneer). The characters here are not well-developed; what was so wonderful about Gone Girl was its utterly unique ability to keep the twists within the focus of what we already knew about the characters. When Gone Girl twisted, it felt like whole new possibilities jumped up within the range of what we had already been teased amp; knew. In The Girl Before, on the other hand, characters are kept ambiguous and dully unlikeable in order for anything to be possible. Worse than that, though, when The Girl Before runs out of places to go, it lurches haphazardly into cliche and a straight-up Gone Girl ripoff, unfortunately borrowing the worse aspect of it: (view spoiler)[Flynn's penchant for false rape accusations, a pattern which is almost exactly duplicated here, with Emma falsely accusing not just one man but THREE SUCCESSIVE MEN of raping her (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.842206"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.842206"]]

Not something I could ever do, by the way. I love my possessions, especially my books. And no pets? Never. But anyway….The story is told in alternating chapters between past and present. Both women who chose the house have suffered loss or harm - a break-in while she was home by one and the loss of an unborn child by the other. So, they have their reasons for choosing something so different. In between the chapters, there are questions from the questionnaire the landlord gives prospective tenants, just so you can see how strange it all really is. This book was a mixed message for me. Some ideas were interesting, like the Japanese cultural ideas that Edward espouses. Or Jane’s comparing of her relationship with Edward to palimpsest or pentimento. But other things just really freaked me out. Like ikizukuri, which is just barbaric. I know, I'm freaked out at the idea of eating live seafood when this is a book about murder. But that sort of thing really sets the tone. There's also a dominance and sex theme. Not talking 50 Shades here, but the man having all the control and calling all the shots. Just not my cup of tea. I had no fondness for any of the main characters either. There's a decent twist towards the end of the book that keeps it interesting and then the ending is positively wild and engrossing. I'm really torn how to rate this. The first ¾ of the book was two stars, but the last ¼ was close to a four for excitement. Guess I'm going with a three. And what is it with the use of “girl” in titles, for pete’s sake? Emma is a woman. My thanks to netgalley and Ballantine Books for an advance copy of this book.

Perhaps he needs a fancy stay at a \"resort\" with soft walls because he's Looney tunes, orrrr maybe he just needs a stiff drink and a good psychiatrist. Either way, he's on the short list of possible suspects when one of the tenants dies in the house that's creepy enough to make you consider staying at the Bates Motel instead. Cue the scary piano/violin combo.The book is written with alternating chapters from the pov of the dead woman as well as the new tenant who is on a quest to find out the truth about what really happened in that house.So, needless to say... It's 2:25 am, and I'm scared to go to sleep. Because I finished this book. I had a whole bunch of mental notes I'd thought of, so I could point out all the unique and down right intriguing aspects of this story,but...that flew out the window, along with my sense of adult logic that tells me not to be afraid of the dark, or of the boogeyman that may or may not be lurking somewhere in the shadows. It's not my fault, it was this nailbiting story that frightened me because I couldn't figure it out. Usually authors give away teensy morsels that tantalize readers and allow them to have a strong suspicion about who's doin' what to whom, and who the psycho is. But oh no, not this time. J.P. Delaney is a talented lil sneak who knows how to make you feel like a 5 year-old hidden under the covers like a scaredy cat. If you enjoy adrenaline-inducing stories, you will love this one. It's complicated, has more twists and turns than a winding road, and the characters are a psychoanalyst's wet dream. Delaney must've done years of research to perfect the complexities of these characters. I'm not just saying that, either. If you choose to read this, you'll know exactly what I mean, because the knowledge in this book regarding a multitide of topics is nothing short of impressive.Normally I don't compare books, but it's safe to say that if you love books like The Girl On The Train, Before I Go To Sleep, Disclaimer or Gone Girl, then you will love this one too.Thanks to Netgalley for letting me read this in exchange for an honest review.

A novel that gained the eyes of editors around the world at the Frankfurt Book Fair and a bidding war started based on 53 pages. A soon to be made movie by Ron Howard. The story of a house and the women who lived in it. The past Emma and the present Jane. The narrative splitting between both characters; in many cases the story repeats itself and you see it from two different point of views. The owner of the house; the minimalist architect Edward and his over 200 stipulations to live in this house. A house that electronically control the environment, the light, the sounds, a house where you can't bring your life in to. I wasn't a fan of Emma she felt too weak and had no power whatsoever over the men in her life, I wanted to scream and shout and tell her to be stronger and not a weak person. Jane develops and evolves with the story and she grows on you. You feel her happiness and pain. Edward on the other hand is cold as ice... a perfectionist control freak, that I wouldn't know why any woman would want to be with him. Why should a woman be fine in living in a house that would cut off her water if she didn't put the dishes back or if she didn't clean the shampoo stain or some other reason... it makes no logical sense and it's 2017. It was a book that flowed nice even if it didn't make sense in some points, and in other parts the author did give early clues for future events that made them less enjoyable. It was a good book and I can see why people would buy it when it comes out."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.853708"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.853708"]]

I love reading reviews from my fellow book bloggers because I trust their opinions and know they won’t spoil anything for me, but on Goodreads/Amazon you just never know. All that being said, I had heard that The Girl Before was getting mixed reactions so I checked things out for myself and it seems people either love this book or they hate it. I happened to love it, but just know that it seems like it’s not for everyone. You have dual perspectives here, Emma is Then, Jane is Now. This style never fails to reel me in and by ten percent I was totally hooked. Emma and her boyfriend Simon move into One Folgate Street together, then two years later Jane moves in alone to start fresh after a tragedy. As the chapters flip back and forth, the similarities between the two women are frighteningly uncanny. One of the biggest complaints that I’ve seen about this book is that no one finds the premise believable. One Folgate Street is owned by an architect named Edward who is a rigid perfectionist to put it mildly. He’s created a sterile, modern home with new technology that’s amazing but also creepy. No house keys are needed, the shower remembers what temperature you prefer, etc. The application prospective tenants must fill out in order to be considered has two hundred questions. That’s right, TWO hundred and they are anything but typical. They require the applicant to answer moral dilemmas and they’re just very odd. He also requires a picture which is just bizarre. Would I ever want to live in a place with a tyrannical control freak as a landlord? No thank you. But as a premise for a book I thought it was fabulous and it didn’t bother me that it wasn’t exactly believable.Beyond what I’ve already discussed I won’t say more about the plot. This was a highly addictive and provocative read for me, a real page turner about the quest for perfection and the obsession that goes hand in hand with it. I was blindsided by one of the major twists and the smaller ones threw me for a loop as well. I can’t wait to see this play out on the big screen as Ron Howard is directing, I think it’ll be fantastic! Again, this seems to be a really polarizing read, you’ll either love it or hate it. If you’ve read it I would love to see which side of the fence you fall on!

After his wife and child died there in a tragic accident, (or was it?) Edward decides to rent the home, but only to those who pass his strict and lengthy interview process.

Jane, who recently lost a child and feels the stark blank walls are just what she needs to help recover, and Emma, the notorious 'Girl Before'.There are moments of great intensity here, but also there were some chapters that fell flat, which is part of why this didn't cut it as a 5 star for me. The other reason is that I really didn't like any of the characters, which made it hard for me to feel any kind of sympathy for their plights. I was hoping for a better ending, although to be honest I can't say just how, so it probably is the best ending possible.

Delaney"], ["date", "Nov 30, 2016"], ["review_text", "I received a copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest review.The Girl Before started out great. It's an addicting psychological thriller about two unrelated women who both, at different times, agree to move into an experimental house designed by minimalist architect Edward Monkford. The house comes with a long set of rules: no clutter, no children, no pets. Nothing but the absolutely essential. Chapters alternate between their perspectives following two different timelines; we have Then: Emma and Now: Jane. Though the young women don't know each other, their narratives parallel and we see Jane falling into the same patterns and making the same choices as Emma did, lending the story a tense air of inevitability - it's like watching two trains about to collide, and it's terrifying.This started out being one of the creepiest thrillers I've read in a long time. I raced through the pages in order to get to the bottom of the mystery. And then it all went downhill.I try my best to write my reviews without spoilers, but all of my problems with this book come down to the twists and reveals, so without further ado:(view spoiler)[1. Emma lying about being raped. On the one hand, I love unreliable narrators, especially in this genre. The fact of Emma being a pathological liar is fascinating, and it's fun trying to wade through her web of deceit to discern the truth. But then we arrive here, and... well. What a letdown. I'm not saying that false rape accusations don't happen. But in a society where allegations of rape are often met with scorn and skepticism, where alleged rapists are let out of prison after six months because of promising athletic careers or even appointed president of the United States, do we really need more fictional accounts of women lying about being raped? Especially seeing as the biggest name in this genre from recent years also focuses on a false rape accusation, it stings even more seeing it repeated here. Once was enough. (I won't name the title because of spoilers, but I think we all know what I'm talking about.)2. The reveal that Simon was the killer. This is one of the rare cases where I think I would have preferred the killer to be the person we all guessed it was on page one, rather than this outlandish twist. In Edward Monkford we have a fascinating and terrifying depiction of a narcissist and a sociopath, someone who seems from the outset perfectly capable of murder. While it seemed a bit too obvious that he was the killer, I couldn't help but to expect it. I wanted to see what drove him to that point, what was enough to make him snap. Even though I thought I had this book figured out, I didn't care. It was still addicting and tense and my heart raced as I tore through the pages, waiting for the final pieces of Edward murdering Emma to click into place. But no, it turns out that Edward's just a bit of an eccentric weirdo, and boring and possessive Simon is secretly crazy enough to murder the woman he loves. Simon was a jerk, there's no doubt about that, but I still didn't really buy this. Something that writers of the thriller genre fail to grasp is that sometimes less is more. Sometimes a bit of predictability is okay if your characters and situations are unique enough, which was certainly the case here. Readers are just as likely to enjoy a book because of its vivid characters - and Edward is certainly that - as unexpected plot twists. Twists like this need to strike a balance between shocking and believable in order to be effective, and this one relied too heavily on the former. 3. Down Syndrome being equated with imperfection and Jane being forced to choose between the epitome of perfection in the house and her 'imperfect' baby... really????? Could we not have told this story without going here??? [note: edited on 12/12/16. I originally incorrectly stated that the baby had autism, while it actually is Down Syndrome, as someone reminded me in the comments. I apologize for the error - I hadn't had the book with me at the time I wrote this review and was going off memory.] (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.866996"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.866996"]]

Unfortunately although I really did enjoy The Girl Before it didn’t turn out to be the “thrilling” read I was expecting. The story is told by two narrators Jane who moves into the perfect house, or is it? There are so many rules and regulations (200 in fact!) some of which are bizarre to say the least, and then other chapters are told from Emma’s POV whose mysterious death, becomes central to the plot. As the past and present become entwined you really can’t help wondering where the plot is heading. One Folgate Street is not a place I would choose to live in that’s for sure, with an obsessive and controlling landlord you just know things aren’t going to end well.The characters in The Girl Before aren’t the most likeable characters I’ve come across they are manipulative, selfish and self absorbed, but I must admit I was eager to learn more about them, and to see how the connection between characters would pan it. There are so many lies and half truths surrounding the two protagonists I found it difficult to know what to believe, but it certainly made me dislike them even more when the author reveals them. As Jane realises her life is running parallel to the tragic Emma’s events take a dark and sinister turn. Interestingly One Folgate Street takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story, which sounds strange but it actually adds a sense of malice and claustrophobia to its tale.Although I read this book in a day, and the plot is highly original personally I found the ease that the two women fall for their landlord less than credible, some scenes read more like 50 shades than a psychological thriller! When I picked up The Girl Before the first couple of chapters hint at the malice and darkness that surround the house, so I was expecting at least a few OMG moments, but unfortunately they never materialised. Don’t get me wrong it was an easy book to pick it up and read in one sitting as It did have elements that I enjoyed I’m sure The Girl Before will be loved by many, but even after the big reveal I was left feeling slightly disappointed as I expected so much more."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.886906"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.886906"]]

Emma, who lives there first, ends up dying under mysterious circumstances. The case can't conclusively decide whether her death was an accident, a suicide, or murder. Jane moves in a little more than a year later, after the apartment had been vacant for a year. As she gets settled in, she learns about Emma, and starts doing a little digging into her death. She quickly comes to find that Emma looks a lot like her, and that they both had relationships with the same man - the architect of the house. One Folgate Street is an architectural masterpiece. It's entirely integrated with technology, and is a beautiful home. That said, in order to live there, there are 200 rules that the tenant has to abide by. Yes, you read that right. 200! Including no books, pictures, or personal items. In addition to agreeing to the rules, in order to live in the apartment, tenants have to fill out a long survey, send in pictures, and complete an in person interview before getting approved. Why anyone would agree to all of that is beyond me. Give up my books?! No, thank you.The Girl Before is positioned as a thriller, though personally, I found it really slow moving. I didn't dislike the build up, but the story didn't feel like a thriller at all (and barely even felt like a mystery) until more than 70% into the book. Details and revelations come very very slowly, and leave the reader little room to guess what happened and what the end of the book would entail. What I did enjoy reading about were the details of the house. While I could never in a million years live in a house with that many rules, the technology the house employed was amazing. Windows that automatically darkened depending on the time of day? Shower heads that were responsive by person and knew the exact water temperature you liked? Yes, please! I also enjoyed that the story alternated between Emma and Jane, so we were able to understand both women and what happened to them as it was happening. That said, their voices sounded identical. It was really difficult to tell them apart, and I found myself flipping back and forth to chapter titles so I could remember whose part I was reading a few times. All in all, I did like the book. I loved the twists and turns that happened in the last 30% of the book. I felt like that's when it really turned into a thriller! The resolution was great, and I really loved the ending and final revelations! If you're looking for a book that's instant action from page one, this isn't the book for you. If you're comfortable with something slow building but interesting and willing to wait a while for the action, definitely pick this one up! I would rate this 3.5 stars if half stars were a thing on Goodreads. Because I loved the last 20%, I'll round up for Goodreads purposes.The Girl Before will be released on January 24, 2017. Thank you to NetGalley, J.P. Delaney, and Random House Bellantine for this eARC in exchange for an honest review.

I started reading and was hooked, so I went ahead and bought it.Five gritty, difficult stars for this whirlwind. I feel so used. I loved the first third of the book, hated the second, and decided that it was all horribly necessary at the end.I debated with four stars because I thought everyone in this book was gross. Even Jane. Not at first, at first I thought she was smart and mature and a really relatable, regular woman. But then she started making appointments with people to find out information and then challenging them when they told her what they knew. Like what? Why are you seeking people out just to argue with them?But as it turns out, all of it was necessary. Edward's ridiculous personality, the house rules that most (all?) independent women would find abominable, the terrible, sad situations that caused these women to allow themselves to be governed, the super graphic sex scenes that take the non-erotica-reading audience by surprise, the selfishness of every. single. person in this book. It is all so staunchly apparent 2/3 of the way through that I found myself really questioning the author's integrity. Why would Delaney hook me like that, get me to pay for the book, and then make me hang out with stupid, annoying, crazy people for the remainder?Well, because (s)he is a genius. As all my initial opinions started falling apart, I started tearing through the book harder. Not so much to find out the ending, but to find out if I'd really been duped. And I thought I had until the very last few pages.What a hell of an ending. After I finished it, I sat around thinking for a long time. I really wanted to give it four stars because I'm still disgusted by everything. But you see, that was the point.Not only that, I was dragged through all these undesirable emotions voluntarily. Someone was controlling my actions, my thoughts, my opinions the whole time, making me think I needed to keep going. But I kept on with it. I kept putting myself through it.

It's already being adapted into a movie, there is a lot of hype, and most people seemed to love it. I wasn't a fan of the frequently changing perspective. The premise of the book - although seriously far-fetched - was unique and the plot really was intriguing. My main issue, I couldn't get excited about any of the characters. They all just left me feeling....pretty much nothing. The one scene that triggered some emotion was the one involving food (if you've read this, you'll probably know what I mean).

There are obviously several twists and turns, and I enjoyed the latter half of the book more while other reviewers actually seemed to prefer the first half.

Most enigmatic is the architect – possibly of more things than just buildings, so the scene is set for a tense and fascinating story.So we get told both stories in alternate timelines – Emma, the girl before of the title and Jane, the current occupant of a house that will divide opinion on whether or not you would like to live in it. Both Emma and Jane definitely do but there are all sorts of hoops to jump through and for Emma it is not going to go so well….This is a clever, twisty and intelligent thriller that leads you down one path then another, exposes each character slowly but surely until you see who they actually are, it is a tense and fascinating build up to a finale that exposes the true colours of everyone involved. In the background, stark and watchful is this place they occupy, a modern and utterly engaging home that sounds both heavenly and irritating in equal measure.Great writing here – really really immersive, descriptively gorgeous, utterly creepy in some parts and an honest to God page turner.

There is an extensive application asking strange questions and then a private interview with the architect if the applicant makes it that far. There is a thick contract listing hundreds of rules that must be followed in order to live there. Who would want to live like that? The house is minimalist to the extreme although every item is top of the line. There is technology up the ying yang and a housekeeper and a gardener. Everything must be perfect. The computer system keeps track of you and even controls the shower temperature and your body's functions like blood pressure. There will be times when questionnaires must be completed. Until they are completed the house shuts down- no water, heat etc.  It didn't appeal to me at all but there are plenty of interested people.

Moving in even after finding a long list of rules to follow to rent the home Jane still believes this is the fresh start she needs. However, Jane finds herself becoming fascinated with finding out what happened to One Folgate Street's former resident Emma. Finding that Emma died within the walls of her new home Jane can't help but investigate to find out the truth for herself before she follows along in Emma's footsteps. The Girl Before is told from alternating points of view between Jane, the current tenant, in the present and Emma, the former tenant in the past. There are often times that there is no clear distinction with dialogue by use of quotations but this really didn't bother this reader at all. I found the story to be immediately gripping and intense as I learned what brought these two women into this home. Both characters in this story are coming from rough times in their lives and needing a new start. When shown the home at One Folgate Street they are told there is a long list of rules to live in the home anywhere from no books to no curtains or changes made to the home. Thinking that a new start is more important than possessions the contract is quickly signed by both and that is where the intensity begins. Now while I didn't quite find this a perfect read in my opinion as there were some things happening that I didn't quite agree with being added into the story I still found myself quite compelled with this one to give it four stars in the end. I'd certainly recommend checking this one out to the thriller fans.

To be granted lease, you must fill in a laborious questionnaire and attend a face-to-face meeting with Edward himself, and even then, you’re unlikely to be approved. There are a large number of rules you have to abide by when you live in the house, such as, no books (?!?!?!), no rugs, no curtains, and no leaving things out, such as clothes, toiletries etc, to name a few. You must also open your home for tours every so often and complete various questionnaires/assessments throughout your stay.So, I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking “who the hell would agree to that?” but as it happens, two women choose to live at One Folgate Street. Thanks to its low rent and dishy architect, both Jane and Emma are happy putting up with all the rules. Jane is the girl from now, and Emma is the girl before. Both women are troubled and both begin a relationship with architect Edward.What follows is a novel full of mystery and sex. If you’re also not into the whole “daddy” thing then this won’t be for you.Starting off this book, I was very worried I was going to hate it, because I’d seen a lot of people say the focus on kinky sex as a bit left field and overpowering to the plot. But, I managed to get over that when it started to appear in the story. In my opinion, it wasn’t as bad as many people had made it out to be and in any case, you can always skip over it. I thought it was going to go full 50 Shades at some moments, but it managed to avoid any of the scenes becoming too tactless.The mystery of “the girl before” is certainly intriguing and kept me hooked (for the first half, at least). I liked the way this was set out as Emma (before) and Jane (now) and how the chapters often mirrored each other so we could see the similarities in each of the tenants lives and relationships with Edward.What I didn’t like about this book was the characters, which I’m kind of assuming was the goal by Delaney? If not, then he/she (does anyone know and can inform me on their gender?) is pretty terrible at creating characters. Although Edward is set up to be our “villain”, I found Emma to be the most dislikable character, even after all was said and done. She was manipulative, unnecessarily forward, obnoxious and total putty in Edward’s hands. Women who can’t act on their own accord because of a man infuriate me, which is probably why I didn’t get on with this novel that well, as it’s kind of what the whole plot is about. I like my women strong and independent! The ending of this novel, no word of a lie, infuriated me. What a total cop out. People are comparing this to Gone Girl, LOL. The conclusion to this novel is the most overused and uninspired “twist” you can ever imagine. What a way to ruin a perfectly OK novel.Thanks to Netgalley and Quercus Books for giving me the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.952218"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.952218"]]

He is a minimalist and is very choosy about who he will lease the house too.

Both have gone through traumatic events in their lives and think the basic no nonsense approach may give them some stability. Emma wants to find a safe place to live after being burglarized and attacked in her home. She is approved to live at the house and moves in with her boyfriend Simon. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is looking to find some kind of solace in the stark walls of the house. Both Jane and Emma bear a striking resemblance to each other and to Edwards late wife.

Was it really just an accident or were there other mitigating factors resulting in Emma’s death?There were some aspects of this book that I did not like but it was still an interesting concept .

I’d like to give it a 3 for some good writing but the story was just so utterly unbelievable and the characters so unlikable that I don’t want anyone to think that I would recommend this book. The author is obviously very talented so I’ll stick with the 3.The premise of the book sounded interesting, and it certainly had some rave reviews from other authors: “Dazzling, startling, and above all cunning—a pitch-perfect novel of psychological suspense.“—Lee ChildFor a thriller to be a real page turner and give me that “tingly, tense” feeling, I need to find it believable. The two main characters, Emma and then Jane are our narrators and the chapters alternate between the two voices. Emma has suffered a personal trauma and supposedly is the perfect type of woman who would be taken in by Edward and his incredibly constricting rules for renting a home that he built with many things computer controlled by someone called “housekeeper”. She has to fill out an application that is about 20 pages long and asks incredibly personal and downright stupid questions. Emma moves in, a victim of Edward’s sociopathic, narcissistic personality and has a relationship with him. Jane is our present day narrator, another woman who suffered a personal tragedy, Same rules, same manipulation, same relationship with the multi-flawed Edward. When she starts to investigate what happened to Emma, Edward becomes furious and cuts off his relationship with Jane. She,however, continues to investigate Emma’s death including befriending her previous boyfriend, Simon. Here enters another component to the puzzle of what really happened to Emma.I could not believe that anyone would want to rent a place that has so many manipulative rules and does not allow you not to bring in anything personal to change the appearance of the stark, minimalist environment. Why would you rent from someone who is so domineering and obviously manipulative?What really put me over the line on this book however was the (*spoiler alert) introduction of the subject of Down’s syndrome. I’m not sure why the author chose to bring up this very sensitive subject in the telling of a psychological thriller. I felt it was out of place and served no purpose. There was also way too much sexual detail in this book, more than I felt was necessary to tell the story. The Girl Before we find out is not really Emma, but I'll leave that to the readers to find out.I would not recommend this book but I’m sure there is an audience out there for it. I did finish it as I wanted to read the outcome but that also was disappointing to me.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher and NetGalley."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.983200"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.983200"]]

I remember reading a sample of this book, and being blown away by its fantastic opening, thinking I can’t wait to continue reading this book! After days of wondering what happened to Emma, how did she die, did the technology in the house kill her or was it the architect himself, does the same fate await Jane? – So many questions! As soon as the full book was made available to me, I dropped everything to finish it.It’s not easy to become a resident of One Folgate Street; first there’s a long list of rules to abide by, second there’s a lengthy application form – not many make it that far, but if you do, you have to past the interview stage of the application process. However, once you’re a tenant, you get to reside in an ultra-minimalist house run by tomorrow’s technology, designed by a world leading architect.Two narratives run side by side in this book – Then amp; Now. Then was Emma, the former tenant, who died under mysterious circumstances, while living there. Now – Jane, the current tenant. From the offset, we know that the two narratives were going to become entwined and I loved the clever way they did.Aimed at fans of Gone Girl, this book does have the unlikeable characters, yes, but other than that I believe this book should stand alone as when I was reading this book, I had no thoughts of any other book, I was so wrapped up in this story. You do start off liking both Emma and Jane, but as the story progresses, Delaney shows us the true characteristics of both these women, and let me tell you, I was not prepared for their deceitful, vindictive nature; at times, some of their actions literally made me cringe. As events unfolded, I was shocked and pulled deeper into the story as I had no idea what was to come; the alternating chapters between Emma and Jane made this book so addictive, each narrative left me wanting more, this book kept me turning pages at great speed.I don’t even know why I bother to guess how books end anymore, or who the guilty party is, as again, here, I made my prediction, and I was so far off the mark, I’m not even going to say anymore. Overall, this book is fast-paced, thrilling and thoroughly addictive, I highly recommend it and I’m sure you’ll fly through its suspenseful pages just as I did.*Thank you to the author (JP Delaney) and the publisher (Quercus) for granting me access to a digital copy of this book via Netgalley*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.986644"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.986644"]]

O leitor fica sempre em dúvida se ele é o herói, a vítima ou o vilão desta história e embora seja uma destas coisas, não consegui gostar desta personagem, com as suas obsessões um pouco bizarras.Quanto às duas protagonistas, gostei de ambas embora tenha gostado um pouco mais da Jane porque teve um pouco mais de coragem do que a Emma mas são duas personagens muito semelhantes, às vezes com as mesmas dúvidas e pensamentos, portanto se não tivesse atenção ao início do capítulo que indicava que ponto de vista se tratava, acabava por confundir ambas.Eu não li ainda muitos thrillers psicológicos mas tenho vindo a gostar de alguns muito bem falados no mercado mas este infelizmente não me convenceu. Li o livro em dois dias pelo tempo disponível e fácil leitura mas tirando o mistério à volt do Edward e do assassino, o livro não puxou muito pela minha cabeça, achei tudo muito mediano.Ainda assim para os amantes do género acho que é um livro que merecesse sem duvida uma leitura, não esperem muito e já agora se conseguirem não leiam a sinopse pois revela um spoiler do livro. http://algodaodoceparaocerebro.blogsp..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.007361"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.007361"]]

It's important to be able to form an independent opinion of a book despite hearing and reading the reviews of others. This is especially difficult when a book has been receiving sterling reviews, as this one has. But in this case, I need to go against the grain and say that this read just didn't do it for me.Despite this book getting off to a promising start, I found that it very soon became unrealistic and lacked substance. I found myself constantly asking \"why would anyone do that?\" or saying to myself \"that would never happen in real life.\" Without giving anything away, let me just say that I don't know of a single person that would agree to rent and live in a house in which they were not even allowed to put a coffee mug down, or to leave the book they are busy reading in the lounge. A house that required the lessee to sign a lease with more than 200 prohibitive conditions, where the lessee had to agree to random surveys about themselves and if not completed within a short time period, certain fundamental appliances in the house would not work, like the shower or the stove. That is all just too ridiculously far fetched for me. I also found Edward to be an unrealistic character and one that would not get very far in real life, let alone be absolutely adored by not one but two woman. I know we are talking about a fictional story here, but still, for me a story must always be believable or else you lose me. So, unfortunately I must conclude by saying that this one won't make it onto my favourites list for this year.

I don't actually have a do not recommend pile but I may have to make one for books such as this.This book follows the stories of two women (eerily similar women but more about that in a moment) who have the opportunity to move into One Folgate Street- a techno-minimalist state-of-the-art architectural masterpiece- at a discounted rent as long as they can abide by a strict set of rules. The chapters alternate between Emma (then) and Jane (now) who discovers that Emma mysteriously died in the apartment and is determined to find out what really happened to her. The story heavily centers around romance, but a twisted and unenjoyable one. After each woman moves in, they are immediately approached by Edward, the owner/architect, who tells them bluntly \"I want to go to bed with you.\" Both women have the same response which is \"Oh, how intriguing. Well, alright then.\" Not... how creepy I don't know you? No thoughts about the potential complications that could arise from sleeping with the notoriously neurotic owner of the building? Not to mention that as the women actually get to know Edward he clearly has some major control issues and so I just couldn't understand their attraction towards him. I'm already rolling my eyes, but then the relationship spirals into a dominating, controlling, obsessive mess that became seriously cringeworthy.I considered DNFing at this point- and I never DNF- but told myself maybe it would be twisty and turny enough to redeem itself and I pressed onward.

Having been a victim of an armed robbery she no longer feels safe in the flat she shares with her boyfriend Simon. Convinced a new house would help with her new start Emma amp; Simon go house hunting but nothing in their price range seems right or, more importantly, safe enough. That is until they visit One Colgate street, a beautiful minimalist house designed by the mysterious (and handsome) Edward Monkton. The only problem iis that to live there you have to agree tiotio follow 200 very strict and bizarre rules, fill in a lengthy questionnaire anbd be interviewed by the architect himself. Despite all this, and her boyfriend's reservations, Emma iis determined to live there. She is therefore thrilled when their application gets approved as she is sure the house will help make her a better person and help aid her recovery from the roibbery. Now: Jane us another lady who really wants to leave her past behind her with a move to a new house. Having recently suffered a still birth Jane can't bear to stay in the house she expected to brinbg her baby daughter home to. Like Emma, she immediately falls in love with One Folgate Street and is convinced that iit will be the new start she needs. Whilst meeting with the architect she finds herself a little attracted to him, so when flowers start arriving she flatters herself thinking they are from him. However a chance meeting with the man leaving the flowers leads to her discovering they are meant for Emma, the lady that used to live there and sadly died in the house. The man leaves before Jane can discover moire leaving her confused and a little uneasy. I've unfortunately had to stop reading this book as I was finding Jane's story quite upsetting. I lost my son, Christopher, at 24 weeks and Jane's experiences were too like my own and bought back a load of really bad memories. I don't know if the author has experienced something similar but it his description bought a lump to my throat, particularly the attitude of the hospital to it all. There were parts of the book I was enjoying up to that part. The dual story line was interesting and the lives of Emma and Jane echoing each other helped to build the tension and made for a interesting read. I wasn't too sure where the story was going as it seemed to deviate off into fifty shades of gray territory at times which was a little confusing. Despite her story being a hard read I liked Jane as a character and found her to be quite sensible. I also understood her more as I knew exactly how she was feeling. I wasn't so sure I liked Emma as she seemed a little silly and out of control and I found her a little annoying to be honest. This book has had a lot of great reviews and hype on social media and I would encourage anyone to read it for themselves and make up their own minds. If you have suffered the loss of a child I would say you should avoid this book as it does make for painful reading. Thank you to Quercus publishers for giving me a copy of this boom to review. I'm glad I tried it as I would have always wondered about it but it was just ok hard for me to finish. I wish there had been a warning regarding the child loss story as I wouldn't have read it."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.039427"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.039427"]]

The Girl Before, really is a book that grips you, it is compelling, breath-taking and has more twists than twister. This is a book that really will tick all the boxes for fans of the psychological thriller, there is the mystery, the intrigue, the changes of pace and twists that you cannot predict to where and when, and like a magician JP Delaney is not afraid to use the sleight of hand.This is thriller is two stories that become one around One Folgate Street, a perfect house for some, with a set of rules for all tenants that are constantly assessed by the technology around the house. The house is designed to be perfect, to some austere to others an architectural dream and to all residents an experiment in a new way of life, for the better.Edward Monkford designed One Folgate Street after the death of his wife and child and it is in a way a monument to them as well as pushing the boundaries of design. The house is not for everyone is it is very minimalistic mixed with cutting edge technology, its own housekeeping system that manages everything within the house, including the tenant. Before a tenant can move in they have to sign a legal document to show that they will not break any of the 200 rules that are in place to manage the house.The story is split in two, between Emma (Then), and Jane (Now) and how they both lived within One Folgate Street and its rules. We also discover the tragic reasons that both are happy to do away with many of their personal possessions to live a new austere life, which Edward Monkford observes and manages for them.Emma and Jane are two totally different people and we see their stories unfold separately but at the same time see how Monkford influences both their lives. Both have been through traumatic events in the life and are looking for change, the stories are told in both the past and present tense which helps to draw you in. At the same time, all the chapters are separated by various psychoanalytic questions the sort that are taken during a psychometric test so there is no right or wrong answer.Throughout the book, we see that both Emma and Jane have obsessions that seem to take over everything that they are doing. Jane’s obsession is Emma and how she lived and died within the house and whether there was any foul play in her death. Jane’s obsession of Emma is destructive in part especially when she feels like the house is spying on her.This book is punchy and will easily become a bestseller and it is understandable why this has already been optioned for film production.

This book is on lists everywhere as one of this years \"it\" books for thrillers. I enjoyed the book, but I also had some problems with it. My husband is an architect so I could relate to much of the details in the story that were architectural and I appreciated that research went into those parts of the story to make it more authentic to the character. I liked the way that the story was told in alternating chapters between our two main female narrators. I thought it was very interesting and creative how the author would tell the stories that were parallel and different at the same time, without confusing the reader. The story itself was interesting and there were little easter eggs throughout the story that helped you figure out who the killer was. However you didn't really arrive at that until about 15% left in the book, although you may have suspicions you are never really quite sure who \"done it.\" I also liked that there were multiple references to Breakfast At Tiffany's through the book, as that is one of my favorite movies. I found the story to be engaging and interesting. I did get to points where I did not want to put it down.There were only a few things that were off putting. The biggest was the author's overused phrase \"he/she goes\" when explaining about another characters talking to the narrator. Now, I read an unfinished copy so that could very well be edited out by the time this hits shelves. Another thing that bothered me is that when you get to about 50% the book suffers from a lot of repetitiveness. It seems that we keep hearing the same thing over and over for some time before the story finally starts moving forward again. That slowed the book down considerably for me. To me it didn't seem that there was a purpose for the story to keep repeating the same information continuously. However, once it started moving again, the story gripped you until the very end. Overall I did enjoy the story and would read more by this author.

Read it in two days.I won this book from the Goodreads giveaway program - an advance reader's edition - and am quite glad I did. I didn't know what to expect, but this was one great read.Told from the POV of two alternating MC's, both young women, in present tense. However, one woman, Emma, is labeled as 'Then,' and the other, Jane, is labeled 'Now.' This makes the story unfold in a rather linear fashion, even though Emma's story is happening prior to Jane's.Confused? Not if you're reading the book. Both women, at different times, elect to live in a highly technologically 'advanced' house designed by an enigmatic and exacting architect. There are a hundred 'rules' to follow in order to live in the house, including no rugs, no books, no pets, and so on, but the house is almost a living thing, digitally wired/enhanced in such a way as to eliminate most 'clutter' and complexity from life. It's clean living elevated to the nth degree, without doors, with all clean lines, smooth surfaces, and just the barest necessities provided. It's warm and clean and safe, and if you hate clutter, you'd love this house.(Myself, I like a little clutter.)Anyhow, both young women are coming from a difficult place - a burglary and possible sexual assault for one, a terrible miscarriage for the other. The opportunity to 'start fresh' and live in such an architectural wonder is appealing to both, but with different outcomes. The way their lives intersect, and what happens when one, then the other get involved with the architect who designed the house, leads to a murder mystery, and revelations that are equally surprising.It was an intriguing read and I've heard that a movie may be in the offing, directed by Ron Howard. Regardless if true or not, I highly recommend this to suspense/thriller/mystery readers.Five stars.

Das Cover und der Titel haben sofort meine Aufmerksamkeit erregt, obwohl ich langsam etwas durcheinander komme mit all den Bücher, die irgendwas mit 'Girl' im Titel tragen. Andererseits ist der Buchtitel durchaus passend für die Geschichte.In der Geschichte begleiten wir Jane, die uns durch die gegenwärtige Zeit führt und Emma, die wir in Rückblicken kennen lernen. Jane hat einen schweren Schicksalsschlag hinter sich und hat nun die Chance auf einen Neuanfang in einem technisch hochmodernen Haus. Das Haus ist sehr speziell und stellt gewissermaßen Ansprüche an seine Bewohner - es verfügt kaum über Möbel, strahlt allgemein keine Gemütlichkeit aus und alles funktioniert digital. Als Jane erfährt, dass ihre Vormieterin, Emma, im Haus gestorben ist, fängt sie an zu recherchieren und deckt so ungeahnte Dinge auf.Durch den Wechsel der Perspektiven lernen wir beide Figuren sehr gut kennen. Allerdings sind sich die beiden nicht unähnlich, es dreht sich oft um ähnliche Begebenheiten, so dass ich manchmal mitten im Kapitel zurückblättern musste, weil unklar war, aus welcher Perspektive ich gerade lese. Beide Frauen haben recht naiv und gutgläubig gehandelt, was mich manchmal schon etwas aufgeregt hat. Wie oft kann man bitte das Schrillen sämtlicher Alarmglocken überhören? Und warum kamen den Damen teilweise erst Monde später Gedanken, die quasi auf der Hand lagen? Nichtsdestotrotz haben mir beide Perspektiven insofern gefallen, dass ich das Buch kaum weglegen konnte. Der sogenannte 'charismatische' Besitzer und Architekt des Hauses war mir jedoch die unerträglichste Person des Buches. Edward wies so viele Parallelen zu typischen männlichen Hauptfiguren in New Adult Romanen auf, dass ich nicht umhin kam, ihn als eine Art 'Psycho-Mr.Grey' zu sehen.Trotz der gewöhnungsbedürftigen Figuren, habe ich die Geschichte in kurzer Zeit durchgelesen. Anfangs war mein Lesefluss etwas gestört von der Tatsache, dass in den Rückblenden die wörtliche Rede nicht gekennzeichnet war, daran habe ich mich aber schnell gewöhnt.Im Verlauf gab es einige Überraschungen und auch das Ende gehörte für mich nicht unbedingt zu den vorhersehbarsten. Alles in allem fand ich das Buch durchaus überzeugend. Übrigens ist auch schon eine Verfilmung geplant, die ich mir dann gerne anschauen würde.*Rezensionsexemplar"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.060780"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.060780"]]

Debo decir que al libro le cuesta un poco arrancar y tarda demasiado en centrar la historia, por tanto si os decidís a leerlo, no tiréis la toalla a la primera de cambio porque a partir de la página 100 se pone más interesante y empiezan a suceder bastantes cosas. Tengo sensaciones muy encontradas respecto a este libro. En ocasiones lo encontraba un poco plano pero el final me convenció bastante y le dio sentido a todo. Pero a pesar de ser un thriller, creo que es uno de esos libros que necesitan reposar unos días para reflexionar sobre él. Para que os hagáis una idea, sería el resultado de meter en una batidora a: \"La magia del orden\" de Marie Kondo, \"50 sombras de Grey\" y un thriller de moda como podría ser \"La chica del tren\" o \"El método 15/33\" de Shannon Kirk.Los personajes son bastante oscuros y todos tienen mucho que ocultar, es complicado saber cuánto hay de cierto en las palabras de cada uno. Las víctimas se vuelven verdugos, y viceversa, en un abrir y cerrar de ojos.Os preguntaréis si era predecible, pero normalmente procuro dejarme llevar por la historia sin pensar más allá y, en este caso, como lo leí prácticamente en el mismo día, tampoco tuve mucho tiempo para armarme mis teorías. Muchas veces hay que meterse en las historias sin intentar adivinar lo que está pasando y dejar que la historia sea la que te sorprenda.En resumen: si os gustan los thrillers es una lectura obligatoria.

The presentation of the story definitely hooked me as there were two narrators and two timelines. That said, both women bore striking resemblances to one another in appearances and experiences. This strengthened my belief that it was a plot I'd already read. Then things started to change shape. None of the characters are particularly likeable but the narrators also turn out to be somewhat unreliable which I found intriguing as I looked at the way information was cleverly presented to the reader to lead the thought process off direction without the narrator changing the story within her own head. The sex is a little too salacious for my taste yet details were sparse, innuendo doing the most work. Besides the sex, the book offered a compelling thriller with story twists I didn't see coming, red herrings planted just so, then discredited, then questioned, then new possibilities arise...Solid thriller.

Delaney's THE GIRL BEFORE has such an alluring premise and there moments where I couldn't put it down. But the far-fetched plot points, pseudo-sexual dominant storyline, and over-abundance of twists and turns left me feeling less than enthused about the novel overall.The story follows Emma and Jane, two women separated by time. In the past, Emma, who is still suffering the effects of a recent home invasion, moves into One Folgate Street with her adoring boyfriend. In the present, Jane is recovering from the loss of her child and hoping to start anew in the house. Designed by renowned minimalist architect, Edward Monkford, One Folgate Street is well-known in the London renter's market. But its occupants—the ones who get through vigorous application process—must abide by an exhaustive list of terms and conditions. Jane becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Emma, the girl before her. But the closer she gets to the truth, trouble follows her putting her life in danger. Is Edward a psychopath desperate for control? Or is there something else going on?On one hand, I reached a point in THE GIRL BEFORE (albeit late in the novel) and I absolutely couldn't put it down. Like Jane, I was desperate to find out Emma's truth. What exactly happened to her? Why was Jane's experiences in the house almost identical to Emma's?But what I wasn't expecting was to be given a dark sexual storyline (just FYI—it's not a romance), that came out of nowhere. It was bizarre. That aspect of the book really threw me for a loop and it wasn't something I enjoyed at all, especially all the \"Yes, Daddy\" talk.I liked the duplicitous characterization that played out in the novel. That led to some interesting revelations for the reader. The transitions between the alternating points of view was seamless, but sometimes due to the characters' almost parallel storylines it was confusing at times to distinguish the two women's story arcs.\n  There was a time when One Folgate Street seemed like a calm, serene haven. Now it doesn't. It feels claustrophobic and mean. Like the house is angry with me.\nEmma's chapters are written without quotation marks, something that was a deliberate choice of style. Though, I'm not sure what it was meant to accomplish. A form of minimalism? To emphasize that she no longer had a voice in the present time? This took some time getting used to and it made it a little more difficult to read. Had I completely understood this writing style choice, maybe I could be more forgiving, but it didn't really make sense to me. The ending felt really rush and, if I'm honest, contrived where Jane was concerned.. We're given almost no resolution with Edward's character, which was disappointing to me.I can definitely see the commercial appeal of this novel and hence, why there is a movie deal. It's a blend of a dark sexual thriller and a whodunit with suspects and motives in every direction. But several plot points didn't work for me and didn't enjoy the book as a whole.*  Thanks to Ballantine Books for the chance to read an early copy.

This book tells the story of Emma before and Jane Now. Both women who have had traumatic things happen to them in their lives and through a long application process are able to rent One Folgate Street. A home built by an eccentric architect who suffered the loss of his wife and son. The home is very stark and occupants must abide by a very long rental agreement.EmmaEmma moves into One Folgate Street with her boyfriend, Simon, after a break in at their home. Soon things start to change and Emma begins a relationship with the strange, handsome architect.JaneJane moves into One Folgate Street after a traumatic loss. She finds the home to be interesting but not as interesting as the architect and the story of the loss of his wife and his relationship with it's former occupant, Emma.I loved how the chapters flipped back and forth between the two women's stories. This made the book a very fast read. Things never got dull. There really is not down time in this book. No long descriptions, no wordy prose. It was actually quite nice to read a bit about one woman in the past and then read about the other woman in the future. Sometimes when books have multiple POW's being told it gets tedious. Not in this book. This is this books strong point IMO. Though going back and forth in time and reading each woman's POW, it soon becomes apparent that the two women are tied together somehow. Even the house itself is like a character in the book as it is built to learn about them and to help make them \"better\".Not everyone is as they seem in this book. I really loved that aspect. Who is telling the truth? Who is the wolf in sheep's clothing? What really happens? Who can we trust? I really enjoyed the twists and turns. This was a very fast read. Very enjoyable and well thought out. Is it the best book I have ever read? No, certainly not but it is a very enjoyable book. Sometimes it is just a pleasure to sit and read a book that grabs one's attention, is entertaining and makes one think.

For one of the first times, I decided to look at reviews before I read. I’m not sure why there are comparisons to Gone Girl or the Girl on the Train beyond the titles, though there is a similar tone in voice to Girl on the Train. That aside, I do think Gone Girl and Girl on the Train were stronger in suspense and tension and also in dealing with psycholical aspects of their characters. But I'm no psychologist so who knows.The setting, a house, in this story is as much a character as the two protagonists, Emma and Jane. They both come and live in One Folgate Street — a perfect and beautiful ultra-minimalist house designed by an obsessive and enigmatic architect named Edward. The house can sense their moods, changes lightning, trace their steps through the house, and monitor everything from the tenants weight, items in the fridge in the cupboard and a host of things that would take a special tenant to cope with. It also has a state of the art security system.Emma, we learn from the blurb, has died in the house after living there for a period with her boyfriend. When Jane comes to live there a few years after Emma’s death it’s hard not to wonder how Emma really died and if Jane will suffer the same fate. I did decide that I knew who the antagonist was very early. This was a little disappointing, and there was a moment two thirds of the way through, where I became very weary of Emma’s constant change of story and at one point it became completely illogical to me --- but that moment passed to some degree, and when it was made clear who the antagonist was, I had that sense of dread till near the ending."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.097476"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.097476"]]

They all seem to be female and they all must agree to an elaborate set of conditions in the lease. The book is told in alternating chapters by two tenants, Emma (the girl before) and Jane. My initial problem with the book was that Emma and Jane aren't girls. They are grown-ass women who should not be so stupid..the whole premise of the book is ridiculous. Unless you have been homeless and living on the streets for six months you would not be desperate enough to sign a lease with 200 conditions with respect to which you will be punished if you do not comply Your mandatory cleaning service is required to spy on you and report infractions to the landlord. And for this you get to live in a house that would make an egg look over decorated. Also sex with Monkford seems to be an unwritten part of the deal (not that either Emma or Jane showed the slightest reluctance). I should know better than to try to read books with \"girl\" in the title. A lot of sex and two incredibly stupid women - this book was definitely not for me.

I received a gorgeous copy of The Girl Before when I was at Harrogate last year, it’s totally white apart from the orange edged pages and the title and authors name are embossed on the cover. But even if I thought that the visual appearance of my copy was stunning it didn’t prepare me for the perfectly pitched plot on the inside. Goodness me I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK! I may even keep it beside me for a little bit longer-I’m not quite sure I’m ready to let it go just yet!Everything about this book worked for me, apart from one little thing and I’ll come to that later! I loved the dual plot thread of Emma (Then) and Jane (Now). Emma’s story felt almost theatrical, and with no speech marks in her chapters there was also a more voyeuristic feeling. That, combined with the sense of creepiness that builds gradually, made me feel as though we were also part of the “housekeeping”in the home that separates the two women by three years. I felt more of a connection to Jane from the very start and have to say that I felt her experiences were handled in a very compassionate and perceptive manner. She was my perfect heroine, intelligent, fearless and strong minded but never easily interpreted.This was a perfect “read in one addictive session” book as I was desperate to find out what secrets the house at One Folgate Street was hiding. Watching the dual stories of Emma and Jane come crashing together was utterly compelling. The one teeny tiny little fly in the ointment for me was Edward, a character that I found to be a little too “Christian Grey” at times, more of a caricature than I would have liked but weirdly enough, he did work within this whole concept of control that ran through the narrative. I couldn’t imagine either of the women falling so deeply under his spell, there was little charisma there for me but each to their own I suppose!  Just don’t get me started on the list of questions that sat in judgement at the start of each chapter! My moral compass definitely found them to be a little more challenging than I would have liked and they certainly caused some rather heated debates within this household!I’ve read that Ron Howard is going to be directing the film version of this book. Now, I have a great respect for him as a director so he had better do this book justice! I’m particularly worried about comparisons with The Girl on The Train as I really didn’t find that film version sympathetic to the book. I do hope that they don’t make the same error here in relocating the setting to New York. Or similar. One of the things I loved about this book was the whole architectural concept, the house at One Folgate Street and the city of London, incorporating the museums, which all seemed so quintessentially British to me so I will be keeping everything crossed!This dark and sometimes disturbing book is proving to be a bit of a Marmite read, having now looked at what other reviewers are saying. It surprised me by surpassing my expectations so I’m sticking my head above the parapet and saying I LOVED IT! So, J P Delaney, whoever you are, I’d like more of the same please!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.108172"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.108172"]]

I enjoyed every page of this thriller.The story is narrated by the two main characters Emma and Jane in a typical Now amp; Then style (where Emma is “then” and Jane is “now”). So, both girls are looking for a new place to move in. Each one suffering some personal trauma and seeking a new start in a new home. After a lot of search, each in her own time finally reaches One Folgate Street, which is beyond perfect. It’s very calming with perfect design. A masterpiece. A dream comes true. However, the owner has terms. Very strict rules actually. As bizarre as this seems, each girl, desperate to be the tenant of this masterpiece, approves to the terms and gets into the process of the application and interview hoping to be the lucky accepted tenant. And what a happy surprise for each to be asked to an interview with the owner and then accepted as the new tenant.Jane is attracted to the handsome seductive owner at once. He is too. And thus, their relation starts. But Jane has her doubts when she knows about the previous tenant and the mysterious crime. As she searches for the truth, she takes the reader with her in a roller coaster of twists and turns where nothing is what it seems to be. I loved this roller coaster a lot. I tried to be the smart girl all along and guess what’s next. Whenever I thought “That’s it. Got you!!” I found my guessing to be wrong. Ha! I always love the double narration and the now and then style. I was caught in and desperate to know what’s next.The handsome seductive owner of One Folgate Street is another issue. He is dark, mysterious yet you can’t help but love him. This is one of the few times when you just like the supposedly villain of the novel. Just like in “Jane Eyre”, or was I the only one who loved Rochester?I also loved the End. I will not be the silly girl who spoils it for you. I will only say that I liked it.The audiobook was also great. I loved listening to it going back and forth between the audiobook and the eBook.Finally, for those who enjoy psychological thrillers, you should read The Girl Before. I highly recommend it.** Special thanks to NetGalley amp; Ballantine Books for supplying my copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review **For all my reviews please visit http://www.meshascorner.net"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.110826"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.110826"]]

Its tormented twistiness tugs at the fraying strings of the characters as they live in the shadow of a peculiar architect’s unconventional vision of perfection.Two distinctive, yet interchangeable, time periods, “then: Emma” and “now: Jane”, begin to reveal the secrets of One Folgate Street. The property itself is quite extraordinary, but so are the uncompromising terms which must be obeyed in accordance to a restricted covenant detailing specific demands of anyone who is granted permission to live there.Emma and her boyfriend Simon, the previous tenants, were at the centre of a break in at their previous home. Emma needs to feel safer and the hi-tec security of this new property offered that, it’s just the rest of their lives that needed fixing. Jane, the current tenant, suffered a stillbirth. She’s grieving and is striving to start again. A clean slate she what she needs, with nothing holding her back just a genuine desire to be content, process her loss, and try to curb her curiosity about the death of The Girl Before.Is it possible for any tenant, no matter how meticulous the selection process, to live up the high standards of such a minimalistic environment, bordering on an impossible regime? Even after jumping through hoops, can they truly reap the full benefits of living in this pristine, clutter free, and questionably affordable property?Well, we soon discover the answer to that question as we meet the key characters desperate to change their lives when completing a curious questionnaire, which initially tests their integrity for selection to their first interview. However, the psychoanalysis continues while they live at One Folgate Street, assessing their quality of life and whether it has improved since becoming a resident.The reasoning behind the odd rules and why these particular individuals were selected is drip fed into their blurring stories. It’s as though the architect’s desire for perfection for the building and the tenant becomes inseparable. The inflexible, obsessive, supremacy of Edward Monkton knows exactly how he wants his plans to perform and there are certain parts of his tenants’ lives that are surplus to requirements.The psychological drama rattles unremittingly until its toxic snake bite of an ending. For a simple catalyst of property hunting to ignite such a perfect spark of intrigue is just pure genius.

After a personal tragedy takes a hold in her life, Jane decides to make a few changes. She leaves her job for another and decides to also leave her home, beginning her search for somewhere better. Upon house hunting, a real estate agent offers her a look into One Folgate Street, where the demands of the house are quite odd, but the house itself made architecturally stunning. Jane takes up the offer on the house and soon finds that there's something eery about a place that's too perfect.

There have been so many \"girl\" books as of late, that sort of always have the same plot and not much of just being thrilling.However, once I began reading, I had a feeling this one was it for me despite not being able to pick up a thriller for quite some time.Immediately, I was hooked. This story was fast-paced and intriguing, so much so that I found myself up late at night unable to put it down, for fear of not being able to catch up and find out all of the answers. I enjoyed the story being told in Emma's (then) and Jane's (now) point of view. I did not find myself getting confused, even though throughout the book you find parallels between the two women and their lives. Though these women are both so different, you can see what similar decisions they make that lead them to ultimately begin living the same life.The writing and the characters were it for me. At times there was such dark writing as we get to see more of Jane's and Emma's history and what has brought them to One Folgate Street, and then we see this vivid writing with details of architectural work and character descriptions.I even became slightly interested in architecture along the way, so props to that! I very much enjoyed Jane, more than Emma, and found myself rooting for her towards finding answers and getting herself out of fate's way. She has this strong independence in her that you don't see in Emma, or in any other character, that I loved.Overall, I had a really great reading experience and I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a thrill. The writing, the characters, the mood will get you hooked and even you'll find yourself marveling at the odd wonder of One Folgate Street."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.133878"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.133878"]]

However, found it a bit impossible to believe at some points, sounded like a TV drama more than a thriller. I found myself thinking - really? People cant possibly be that stupid, right? Or I am just naive. So yes, I found one of the main characters annoying. Very annoying, she just could not decide what kind of person she is, and that melodramatic jumping from being broken victim to strong crazy sexy woman was ridiculous.

Delaney estreia-se no mundo editorial com A Rapariga de Antes, um thriller psicológico que tem tido bastante aceitação da parte dos leitores, após a sua publicação no início deste ano. Na realidade, trata-te de um pseudónimo do autor inglês Tony Strong, que para além de publicar com o seu nome, tem vários livros editados com o pseudónimo Anthony Capella (também publicado em Portugal).Por causa do hype em redor deste lançamento e porque recentemente este género me tem revelado boas surpresas, a minha curiosidade ficou bastante aguçada e foi com avidez que iniciei esta leitura. A narrativa alterna capítulos sob o ponto de vista de duas mulheres, Emma no passado e Jane no presente, enquanto o leitor vai acompanhando a ida de ambas para o n.º 1 Folgate Street, uma casa londrina bastante sui generis e que desde o início do livro parece tanto uma personagem real como as duas mulheres.Esta casa é uma criação única do afamado arquiteto Edward Monkford, que só permite que alguém lá resida se cumprir uma série de requisitos e se comprometer a seguir várias regras para lá morar. Tanto Emma como Jane passam no teste e acabam por se envolver com Edward, assumindo a história um paralelismo afetado pelo ambiente peculiar da casa. Jane acaba por saber que a anterior inquilina, Emma, morreu dentro da casa em condições algo estranhas e decide investigar o passado de Emma, o que a leva a caminhos sinuosos e cheios de revelações.A Rapariga de Antes é um livro que fala de obsessões. A mais evidente é a obsessão pelo minimalismo da parte de Edward, fruto do seu transtorno obsessivo-compulsivo. A casa é um reflexo dessa sua faceta, aqui levada ao extremo não só pelas várias exigências que faz aos seus inquilinos, mas também pela tecnologia presente, que parece esconder sob a capa da inovação e modernismo a invasão da privacidade dos seus moradores. Mas também há personagens com obsessão pela mentira, por uma pessoa em particular ou por determinadas práticas sexuais.Foi um livro que li num ápice, curiosa por saber o que, afinal de contas, tinha acontecido a Emma. Gostei bastante do início do livro, em especial pelo ambiente algo sinistro que o autor consegue criar, mas pareceu-me que a difícil tarefa de o manter ao longo de todo o livro acabou por não ser completamente bem sucedida. No final de contas, é um thriller psicológico interessante, com boas ideias e que, apesar de não ser perfeito, proporcionou boas horas de leitura."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.194257"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.194257"]]

The Girl Before is a fascinatingly frustrating read wherein the narrative is so much more clever and compelling than any of its characters, particularly the main two heroines, the girl before, Emma, and the girl after, Jane. Those two are just...insipid, infuriating, maddening. The book itself is essentially Fifty Shades of Grey with architecture. Both Emma and Jane in their respective timelines, which are precision interweaved throughout the story, occasionally dizzyingly so, fall for an obsessive compulsive domineering architect with Samp;M tendencies, Edward, after coming to live in his showcase of a house. Appropriately both the house and its creator have all the charm and warmth of a particularly ascetic modern design, you know the sort with limited number of uncomfortable overpriced furniture and slick austere nothingness. Yeah, that, apparently irresistible to a certain type of women, someone's who's undergone a recent tragedy, for example. And so the games begin...while Edward can't be entirely trusted, neither can as it turns out anyone. Delaney muddies the waters with unreliable narrators and suspense, so you just have to find out what's going on, and to her credit she does create a dynamic fun sort of a thriller, almost in spite of her oversexed imbecile characters. And so as entertaining as it was, the estrogen just overwhelmed it much too much for it to be genuinely good. Maybe I'm not its typical target audience. This was quite possibly meant for those who thought Fifty Shades of Grey needed some suspense and a murder or two. Maybe I shouldn't be referring to the book I haven't actually read, but I know the gist, doesn't everyone by now. At any rate shame to see an obviously talented author limiting herself to a trend, trends are stupid for the most part anyway, but surely money talks and all that.

One has shadowy parents, neither has siblings, and they are neatly set adrift with minimal back story in north west London, where we all know that the rents are high and the people unfriendly, apart from the single chatty neighbour.The architectural context could have been interesting but it was confined to some superficial descriptions of buildings (all of which involved \"pale stone\": could have done with some editing, I think) and lists of names of famous architects. A smattering of medical jargon was thrown in for good measure.As for the plot, the true villain was obvious to me from the earliest pages.

I absolutely could not put this book down and finished it in three days instead of one only because I had to go to work.The story is based around a house located at One Folgate Street. There are two women who apply to live in the house and the story is told from their points of view from the time they apply to the time they leave the house. In order to live in the house, applicants must agree to a long list of rules that were created by the builder who originally built the house to live in with his now deceased wife and son. Emma, lives in the house first with her boyfriend Simon. Then several years later, Jane lives in the house. The fact that the two women look alike and also look like the builder’s deceased wife with dark hair and blue eyes is slightly unsettling. I really enjoyed reading this book because the characters came to life through the author’s writing. I could imagine the open floor plan of the house and each room from the kitchen (they called it something else in the book) to the bathroom with the sensor-activated shower head to the hidden panel that lead to the mop and broom closet. The answer seems so obvious to what happened to Emma, so of course, I knew there had to be a plot twist.

An architecturally interesting house is yours for an incredibly low rent if you answer pages of personal questions, agree to live by an enormous number of rules, and somehow please the architect.

Juxtaposing the lives and experiences of these two different women inside of the same house at different times was fascinating. A peek into the suspicious death of the architect's wife and child added to the intrigue. And now the negatives: at the half way point suddenly the story seemed trite. Edward the architect suddenly starts sounding like Christian Grey (of 50 Shades fame). A psychotherapist willingly shares notes from Emma's sessions with Jane.

Yes, it’s an above average psychological thriller, just barely. It’s a story of two women who have previously been traumatized and want/need to move to begin anew. The story is told in alternating chapters of both characters. These ladies are drawn to this austere building that requires the completion of a complex multiple-choice questionnaire, along with pictures. In addition, there is an in-depth, multipage contract that the occupant must agree to and sign. Along with the telling of the story, the reader learns of some of the questions. The house has a history of occupants suffering traumas (aka deaths) while living in the house. As a reader, one wonders who in their right mind would go through the dog and pony show, agree to the contract, and move in. Through the description provided, the house didn’t sound that fabulous to agree to such crazy stipulations. Author JP Delaney does scrape up a thriller in the question of how previous women met their demise and who was responsible for the downfall.Nonetheless, this reader finished it. As absurd as it sounds, there is a true thriller aspect to it, if you mindlessly go along with the basic foundation. Do I recommend it? Not really. There are far better thrillers out there.

I’m still glad I ended up reading it, but it definitely wasn’t as good as I was expecting, and ended up being more of a fence sitter.The story is told through alternating POV. The newest resident of One Folgate Street, Jane, and the girl before, Emma. We know right from the get go something had to have happened, obviously, because One Folgate Street is back on the market and not still being lived in by Emma. I found the premise of the house itself to be more intriguing than the lives of the women and the people in their lives. Hell, I wanted to move into One Folgate Street after reading the descriptions of the location and how the house itself was set up.This is tagged as mystery/thriller/suspense, and really all of that revolves around Jane trying to figure out what happened to Emma. The author really tries to make the reader suspect one person right from the get-go, but I’ve read too many mysteries to fall for it, and gradually came to the conclusion myself who the perp was before it was revealed.Overall, when I finished the story I was left with the thought that you really never know anyone 100%, and Every. Single. Person. has secrets. Ever person in this story has had something traumatic happen to them:-Emma: House was broken into and she no longer feels safe.-Jane: Had a personal tragedy regarding a pregnancy.-The Architect: Lost his wife and child years before in an architecture related accident.But when it really came down to it, I kinda felt like the architect was the only one that was sort of coping with what happened to them, and trying to move on. Emma and Jane always came off to me like they were just trying to fill a void in their lives, rather than accepting the fact that you can’t fill the voids that struggles have left you with. Square peg, round hole. A thing can never be broken or cracked and be remade to be exactly what it was before.I would recommend this book to those who don’t have strong background in reading mystery. I think those readers are the ones that would enjoy this the most. I guess I’m just too jaded so everything was really obvious to me. Still really happy I read this, finally, and would most likely look into something else from this author.Copy received through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.259856"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.259856"]]

I had heard such good things about it and I honestly didn't want to be disappointed. Too much hype surrounding a book release often leads to let down in my literary experience. I’m happy to say, this book was well worth all the buzz and more! However, now I need to try to sum up my reading experience without ruining it for anyone else….hmmmmm. Here I go!The Girl Before alternated seamlessly chapter by chapter between its two main characters, Emma and Jane. The story was told both in the present day with Jane and in the past with Emma. Both women were reeling from personal tragedy and searching for big changes in their lives. Jane was looking for a new place to live after suffering through the stillbirth of her first child. Emma had experienced a home invasion and was held at knife point. The exact events that occurred during the attack have been blurred by trauma. She wanted to remember the attack, but also forget at the same time.At the different times in the book, both of the women were shown the same home...the spectacular minimalistic house - One Folgate Street. The house was extraordinary. The house was the winner of architectural awards, its design was simple and sleek. But this house had a violent history and a determined, unwavering owner, Edward Monkford. Edward had a reputation of being a handful to deal with. The application process, the rules, and the way of life that the Edward demanded of you to live in this house, would have made the average person run away screaming. But not these two, they were blinded by the house's beauty and the idea of a simplistic lifestyle allured their senses.The twisting tale of these women and their experiences with the house and Edward kept me up at night, and reading until the wee hours of the morning. In my personal down times, I found myself contemplating where the plot was heading, and who was the true villain in the story? I changed my mind over and over. If you were to ask me, that's the true sign of great storytelling! That and the fact that I feel like I can't put all my thoughts on this one into this one review. It would be a disservice to how good this book was!Now, with that being said I don't think this book is for every reader - as most aren’t. I think people who enjoy mystery and thrillers will like it. The people who like to identify with the characters in the book may not. I personally didn't really like any of the characters. Jane was probably the most likeable for me. Edward was a big double thumbs down, a real turn off for me! I don't care how good looking and powerful you are or pretend to be, no one is going to tell me how to live! End of story!

Emma has just experienced a traumatic break in at her flat and is looking for a new place to live, but can’t seem to find something that is both affordable and feels safe to her. Until she looks at One Folate Street. The house is a minimalist design made of pale stone, high ceilings, plate glass and a very open floor plan and is considered to be an architectural masterpiece.But the enigmatic architect who designed the house has over 200 rules for living there, including no books, no photos, no clutter, no throw pillows or other personal effects as the house is meant to transform it’s occupant. Jane has just suffered a personal tragedy and is looking for a fresh start, which she believes she has found at One Folate Street. The space seems to bring her a sense of calm that she hasn’t felt in a while and she also feels drawn to the architect who created it. Shortly after moving in, Jane learns about the death of the home’s previous tenant; a woman who has a similar appearance to her. As Jane begins to investigate what happened, she has to untangle the truth from all the lies. She unknowingly begins to the follow the same patterns, make the same choices and cross paths with the same people and also begins to experience the same terror, as the girl before.I received an ARC of The Girl Before about 3 months ago and I so wish I had read it sooner because I absolutely loved it. It was not at all what I expected it to be. The story, as mentioned above, is told from two perspectives; Then: Emma and Now:Jane. So the perspectives switch every other chapter but it was very easy to follow alone. Also, in between most chapters is a question from the application package when the girls applied to One Folate Street and from the follow up surveys the girls filled out while living there. I also thought that was a nice touch and some of the questions did make me stop and think for a moment. I don’t want to give too much of the plot away but I do want to mention a few things. I really liked the author’s writing style and I felt that even though we split time between Emma and Jane, we got to know their characters pretty well. The architect, Edward, is also a very interesting character. This was one of those books that I could not stop reading because every time I thought I had the plot twists figured out, it would go in a different direction. I read almost the whole book in one day. It really captivated my attention. I can honestly say most of the plot twists I didn’t figure out until they happened and the author did a really good job with that. And the ending was also pretty good, not as dramatic as I had expected it to be, but unexpected. There is some sex in this book, which I like to mention when it’s a book that I normally wouldn’t expect to contain detailed sexual encounters. The scenes are all well done and it is nothing over the top. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.Thank you to the publisher for sending me an advanced reading copy of this book."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.284377"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.284377"]]

Years apart, each woman applies to be a tenant and each woman develop their own relationship with the man behind the design, Edward Monkford. When Jane finds out that years earlier, the previous tenant, Emma, died in the home, she begins investigating the death. Untangling a web of lies, she follows down a similar path and soon finds herself in the same danger as the girl before.The Girl Before, by JP Delaney (a pseudonym), is a book that has been getting consistent amounts of buzz in the book blogging world; I was dying to read this one!I was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy and I have to say, I have some seriously mixed feelings about this book. I found myself feeling equal parts mesmerized and strange while I was reading. What I Liked:  The Narration: the novel is narrated with alternating viewpoints from tenants at One Folgate Street: Jane, the present tenant and from Emma, the woman who lived there previously. This technique kept me glued to this book. The segmented chapters are short and sweet and use the right amount of hook to carry the story along. As the women’s experiences begin to mirror each other, things become creepy really quickly. Throwback to Gothic Literature: Fun Fact. I have always been a fan of classic gothic fiction and this novel certainly resonates with this genre. From the massive, sterile house to our female protagonists threatened by a powerful, tyrannical male, this one had moments where it read like Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho. I really liked how this one gave a modern twist on the gothic novel and combined it with the domestic thriller genre that has swept 2016 by storm.What I Didn’t Like:  Kind of gave me a Fifty Shades of Grey vibe: Edward Monkford was Christian Grey to me. The novel had moments where sexual domination took the lead and the actual story took the backburner. I have a very hard time taking a book seriously when the character, which is supposed to be the antagonist, is consistently referred to as “Daddy”. I feel like I would have enjoyed the book much more if this part of the book had taken on a smaller role. Regardless of my feelings about that portion of the book, I cannot deny that this one kept me up, late into the night, to finish. I was consumed by the plot and need to find out what happened. It already has the movie rights sold, so I will be intrigued to see how this will play out on the big screen. If you are a fan of a dark, twisting thriller, then I would recommend this book. However, if you hated the idea of Fifty Shades of Grey, then chances are, you will not appreciate this one either! Thank you to Penguin Random House Canada and the author, JP Delaney, for a copy of this one!

For Emma, she requires a safe place after being the victim of a break-in while her loyal boyfriend, Simon, was out. For Jane, it is a new place that holds no reminders of the baby she lost. For each woman, the house at One Folgate Street seems to offer exactly what they are looking for. It is designed by well-known architect, Edward Monkford, and comes with a set of rules created by the inscrutable man himself. In fact, to live at One Folgate Streets means signing off on over 200 rules, ranging from no books or personal mementos, to total tidiness, to agreeing to showing the house on architectural tours, to accepting to the intense technology that it comes with, including the house monitoring your well-being and moods. At first, the rules and clarity that come with One Folgate Street seem comforting to Emma and Jane. But as they spend more time in the house--and learn about its past, including its mysterious builder--they become terrifying and stifling. THE GIRL BEFORE is a fascinating novel told solely from the point of view of Emma, One Folgate Street's previous tenant, and Jane, its current tenant. All activities are filtered through the lens of these two women. The novel effectively builds suspense with the parallel nature of the two women's stories, but it also can get a little repetitive at times (and sometimes a little confusing, as you have to remind yourself, mostly in the beginning, who is talking). The book starts off exciting, as you are drawn into both Emma and Jane's tales while they acclimate to the house and all the oddities it offers. The house itself almost becomes another character in the novel. It starts to drag a bit halfway through as you wonder what will happen in the next half (people living in a technologically advanced house can only be so exciting, right?). But then, suddenly, the novel takes some odd turns (there are some interesting sexual plot twists) and eventually grows quite interesting again with some psychological and thrilling revelations. Perhaps my favorite part about this book is that many of these developments truly surprised me, which isn't always easy to do in a thriller. Overall, this is an interesting novel. It's certainly suspenseful and different. To enjoy it, you really have to set your disbelief aside at the actual conditions of living at One Folgate Street (no books, what?!) and accept that the two women are so broken (and perhaps broke, as the house apparently comes at a great discount) that they will go along with anything. It has a lot of varied plot threads and some of them aren't always fully explored or truly necessary, which can be a little frustrating. Still, the book truly surprised me with its twists and kept me entertained, with a deep desire to get to the end. Overall, 3.5+ stars.

While this book is being touted as the next Gone Girl/Girl on the Train (which is becoming tiresomely overused), I wish it would have been advertised as the next Fifty Shades of Grey so I would have known to steer clear. I am not surprised at all to see this novel being made into a movie adaptation and I suspect it will be quite well received by many. The relationship aspect, which was a huge part of the novel, was just not for me. I don't typically enjoy emotionally damaged women that are helpless to the charms of men simply because they are rich and handsome, nor do I enjoy novels reflecting such an uneven balance of power and/or huge red flags for an abusive relationship but the women stay because the sex is good. So those parts of the story just did not work for me. I will say, however, the mystery aspect of this book is really well done here - the plot really keeps you guessing (I didn't figure out some things until the very end) and the use of the house as a character is really very clever and effective. There is a certain level of voyeurism at play with the reader - I particularly liked playing along with the quizzes/moral dilemmas - a very successful plot device - and the introduction of life choices (how does one evaluate possessions). I also now want to incorporate karesansui into my next home (I love being introduced to new concepts). But I found myself enraged at one character that literally eats food that is absolutely abhorrent to her because she thinks it will turn a man on and another character that grossly misrepresents a sexual assault.

But this one intrigued me, and I'm glad I took the chance. This is a unique, beautifully told story.The book is written in alternating timelines, both in first person. Each character has a distinct voice and a strong personality. I didn't particularly like either woman, in that I wouldn't choose to hang out with them in my real life, so the fact that I enjoyed spending time with them fictionally speaks volumes about the author's storytelling talent. I found Jane to be a much more sympathetic character, and some of her scenes in particular were incredibly powerful. Both characters are complex and well developed.As I write this, the pre-publication promotion touts this book as a psychological thriller. 'Thriller' doesn't fit. It's far more of a slow-burning suspense. This is the type of book that gets under your skin with foreboding darkness, the hint of things to come, and the way the characters, and we as readers, remain slightly off balance throughout. Much of the story takes place within the house at One Folgate Street, with its minimalist design and enforced lifestyle. I was fascinated by the author's approach to this unique concept as a foundation for the story.My only grumbling point is a stylistic choice made by the author. Delaney does not use quotation marks for dialogue throughout Emma's POV sections. I came across this method once before in experimental literary fiction. I didn't like it then, and I didn't like it this time either. Quotation marks are subtle reading cues we don't even notice until they're missing. Their absence forced me to think more in order to figure out if sentences were being spoken aloud, thought, or were part of the narration. For me, this hurt the story's flow, as I was constantly questioning the way I interpreted things. Jane's POV sections do have quotation marks for the dialogue, so I'm not sure what the point was in choosing not to use them for Emma's parts.*I was provided with an advance ebook copy by the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for my honest review.*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.295286"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.295286"]]

One Folgate Street is an architectural masterpiece, completely minimalist in its design. But, the owner of the home, Edward, is incredibly controlling and finicky about who can live there. To be considered as a tenant for the house you must fill out a questionnaire than can only be described as bizarre and intrusive. And, there are rules to living at One Folgate Street. No throw pillows, no pets, no photos, no clutter and no books just to name a few. The story follows two women’s tenures at One Folgate Street – Emma, who is recovering from a traumatic break in and searched out a new place to call home, is the “before” and Jane, recovering from a personal tragedy, is the “now”. After Jane realizes that Emma had met a deathly end inside One Folgate Street she starts to do some investigating into Emma and what she finds is unsettling. I won’t really go into any further detail on the plot but this book is incredibly creepy and will have you hooked until the end. I couldn’t read it fast enough. Is the owner/designer of the house a dangerous man? Or is he just controlling? Was Emma murdered? Was her death an accident? Does the house have a mind of its own? There is an element here that reminded me of 50 Shades of Grey when the story delves into the sexual relationship that brews between Edward and both Jane and Emma; that is something I could have done without. This is going to be made into a movie adaptation and I think it will be a really good, creepy movie.

I was kept on my toes all the way til the end of the book and loved the little twists thrown in at the end.

Both experienced tragedies before moving into the home. They had to fill out questionnaires and send pictures and agree to a slew of rules to even be considered as renters (no simple credit check and steady job could get them into this sterile, odd place). The home won architectural awards, but residents who live there can’t leave dishes out—even the cleaning supplies are well hidden in a secret wall panel. There aren’t even book cases—no clutter is allowed whatsoever. I couldn’t imagine living like that (I wouldn’t make it a day), but both women are in dire financial situations, and the home is modestly priced because no one would live there with the millions of rules if they could afford a normal place. I couldn’t identify with Emma or Jane or the architect of the home, Edward, who is a perfectionist and possibly a sociopath (hence the creep factor).There were some nice twists and turns I didn’t see coming, which is great, but I didn’t fall in love with the ending.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jun 07, 2017"], ["review_text", "Just another thriller to add to the growing pile of subpar genre fiction. All the publishers seem focussed at the moment on finding the next Gone Girl or Girl on the Train. This is being sold in most places as a powerful new female driven thriller, or to use a buzzword, \"domestic suspense\" The writer \"feels gratified\" at how people think HE is a woman because he wrote two women so well. Yes, JP Delaney is male, and no I don't hold that against him. What I do hold against him is the fact that I wouldn't consider writing two women who portray all the stereotypical aspects of the Hysterical Woman to be writing women well. Emma-Manipulative-Unappreciative-Sex crazed-Proned to fetishism-Compulsive liarJane-Grieving the loss of a baby-Desperately wants another baby-Focussed on her career and miss out on family and love-Calculating-SecretiveEmma and Jane-Both develop an almost instant obsession with Monkford-Both seem to have sexual awakenings because of Monkford and discover they lean toward fetishism-Both spurn the same man (Simon, and to a much lesser extent, Saul) to be with Monkford-Both give up huge amounts of personal connections in order to be with Monkford and live in Fulgate Street-Both are suspicious and deceitful I really felt, as I continued to read these two women that they are each one side of a coin, making one whole woman, who, if she lacked Emma's compulsive lying and Jane's need for a baby, might just be the perfect woman. But you throw Monkford into the mix and both women become putty for the moulding. They both lose all credibility and chance for redemption the second they let Monkford control them. These aren't well written women, they're caricatures of women that men who are anti-woman think represent or resemble women as a whole. Thematically, my interest was completely lost when the grieving mother storyline entered. Not that I don't have sympathy for any mother who has lost a child, but because I can't identify with it. I feel that this theme or subplot really alienates a large section of the female readership (which is in turn a large section of general readership of all books)I am not a woman on a quest for a child and when this becomes such a prominent storyline in any book, it's like the shutters just drop and I'm thinking \"here we go again\" the woman is having her actions explained away because \"her condition made her do it\" or maybe it was \"her fragile state of mind\" If you think this is a contentious point, look at these books for examples of exactly the same device:-Pretty Baby by Mary Kubica (proof is in the title here)-The Couple Next Door by Shari Lapena (also a second rate and utterly awful book)-The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins (she was never pregnant but many of her actions are driven by the desire for her husband's new life which includes the baby that should have been here)-Leave Me by Gayle Forman (she ditches her husband and kids because they're essentially shitty people who do nothing for her then gets involved with two other people with child related issues)It would be cool if Delaney had written these women as two different kinds of villains, which is essentially what I think he was going for, but without turning them into stereotypes. Make them utterly morally repugnant, don't just hover on the border of \"hmm maybe they'll make some questionable decisions\" it's a cop out. I liked Simon as a character, I felt he had the most depth. He was the darker side to Monkford's darkness. He masquerades as the doting, adoring boyfriend who would do anything for his girlfriend or wife when he is actually using kindness as a method of control. While Monkford is outright controlling and upfront about it from the start. I hated the ending where a new character gets introduced for one chapter. This is probably a tool left in place for potential sequels, but it really irks me. Finish books properly, a really clever writer can write a sequel without leaving themselves an entry point in their previous work, just in case they get a sequel. Also, can we stop with the alternating viewpoints please? PLEASE?! It's so tired and over done. I'm at the point where I won't buy a book if this is the method of writing. I didn't think this was a revolutionary book in any way, I resent a little the hype this was given at publisher events prior to publication because it definitely didn't live up to them. It's not the next big thing and I'm not in a hurry to read anything more by this author."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.339873"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.339873"]]

There's a lot going on and it's difficult to figure it all out. I'm still not completely sure I have it all figured out. I normally don't like books like that, which leave me with questions, but in a way, it felt right with this book. The whole book has an air of mystery and it feels ok to leave something on the table.This is also the kind of book where no one really comes out looking great. It's difficult to tell who is a \"bad guy\" and who is a \"good guy.\" Everyone had issues, and that's part of what brings them together, and ultimately, tears them apart.I really liked the suspense of it all.

Представете си една безупречна, фантастична къща с много светлина, простор и минималистичен стил, чийто собственик е известен архитект. На пръв поглед изглежда невъзможно точно тази перфектна къща да бъде следващото ви жилище.Модерната сграда на „Фолгейт Стрийт 1“ е като от онези снимки в списанията – изглежда недостижима и специална и в нея не може да живее всеки. Даа, сигурно трява да има някаква уловка, би било твърде хубаво, за да е истина, нали така?Изобщо не се учудвам, че романът вече е преведен на 39 езика и се е превърнал в бестселър, който предстои да бъде екранизиран под режисурата на носителя на „Оскар“ Рон Хауърд, известен с филми като „Аполо 13“, „Красив ум“ и „Шифърът на Леонардо“. И да, неслучайно сравняват „Момичето преди“ с „Не казвай сбогом“. Предричам, че много ще се говори за тази книга и тепърва ще я виждам в ръцете на мнозина – в метрото, на пейката в парка, на плажа…„Момичето преди“ е точно това, което търся в един криминален роман – необикновена история, чиято сюжетна линия да ме грабне, да ме накара да прелиствам шеметно страниците и да ме остави удовлетворена след прочита. Психологическият трилър деликатно засяга и доста социални теми, което за мен го прави още по-пълноценен. Така че, ако сте фенове на този жанр и си търсите нещо добро за четене, горещо препоръчвам да се запознаете с „Момичето преди“!Цялото ревю - тук: http://azcheta.com/momicheto-predi-dz..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.359619"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.359619"]]

Es scheint zu schön um wahr zu sein, die Wohnung ist sehr günstig und dazu noch hochmodern ausgestattet. Allerdings ist der Einzug in diese 4 Wände an eine Vielzahl von obskuren Regeln gebunden, die das Architekten Team aufgestellt hat. .Es darf nichts auf dem Boden herumliegen, es gibt keine Papierkörbe, keine Wäscheleinen und keine Sofakissen – Treppengeländer und Absicherungen stehen genauso auf der Verbotsliste wie natürlich Haustiere und Kinder. .Trotzdem überlegt Jane nicht lang, da sie sowieso ihr Leben ändern möchte und einen kompletten Neuanfang wünscht und willigt ein. .Parallel zu Janes Geschichte lesen wir immer wieder Abschnitte aus der Vergangenheit von der direkten Vormieterin Emma die auf tragische Weise in eben diesem Haus ums Leben gekommen ist. Auch Jane ist auf das Mysterium um Emmas Tod gestoßen und beginnt zu forschen. Sie findet heraus, dass die beiden Frauen sich nicht nur sehr sehr ähnlich sehen, sondern auch, dass ihre Geschichten um die Folgate Street 1 auch exakt gleich abgelaufen sind! .Bedeutet das nun etwa, dass auch Jane diesem Haus zum Opfer fallen wird? Und was hat überhaupt der verschrobene, perfektionistische aber gutaussehende Architekt Edward Monkford mit der ganzen Sache zu tun?Dieses Buch hat es geschafft, mich von der ersten bis zur Letzten Seite zu fesseln. Zwar war mir Emma nicht durchweg sympathisch, aber sie war authentisch und das ist das wichtigste! Ich habe total mitgerätselt wie das alles nun zusammenhängt und bin durch viele Wendungen gegangen die ich so nicht erahnt hätte, das Ende war sehr überraschend aber es passte perfekt und erschien nicht konstruiert.Klare Leseempfehlung von meiner Seite aus wenn ihr auf Psychothriller steht!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.362300"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.362300"]]

It was only the beginning but I could feel myself being frightened by the eerie sense the story gave. By this alone, I was amazed by how the author could do this to my reading experience so very quickly.One Folgate Street is very secure and private. It has the latest technology for the security system. The house comes with a whole set of rules and is set for a simple lifestyle without the added essentials of our lives. The house felt like a character in the story and it's what elevated the creepy feel.\"It has—well, it's a pretentious word, but it has integrity. I think he's looking for people who are prepared to be equally honest  about the way they live in.\"Emma is an unreliable, unlikable character who has issues. She went through a burglary and a possible sexual assault, which is what leads her to want to move out of her home and search for a safe place to start over. One Folgate house is the perfect place to start fresh, especially after what she went through. She meets Edward, who's the architect of the One Folgate House. Very soon, they start dating and Emma loves all the attention she receives from him. Unfortunately, something happens that ends with Emma being dead.Perhaps the house will turn me into a better person. Perhaps it will bring order and discipline to the random chaos of my life.Jane is a strong, independent, brave woman who went through a miscarriage. After the miscarriage, she quit her job and found a job in helping other mom's who go through miscarriages. Because of this, her income is low, but the prices for an apartment or house are high. One Folgate Street is the only one that Jane can afford. She sends in her application and is accepted. She feels very safe in the house and is happy with her decision of living there. When she starts seeing Edward, a few questions arise and slowly, she starts to question her relationship and her living situation.But what if the house itself decides not to protect me? How safe am I really?Edward is a controlling, manipulative man that I found myself being disgusted by. At first, I was kind of liking him and drawn to him, but when he treats Emma in the past the same way he treats Jane in the present, says the same things, gifts the same things, I was just appalled and creeped out by him. His character did enhance the eerie feel of the story, which I did like a lot. I couldn't figure out his motives and that still made him interesting to me.\"Excellence is what matters. Excellence and originality.\"The last two chapters of the story had me saying WTF so many times. I have no idea how many times I re-read those pages. I'm telling you, there's a whiplash at every turn the story makes! The story had lots of twists that had me doing a double-take and re-reading the pages because I couldn't believe what was happening.The Girl Before is a mindblowing and addicting masterpiece that left me completely transfixed and fascinated.This review was originally posted on Latte Nights Reviews."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.393618"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.393618"]]

The premise is great, if rather batty (who would honestly agree to live in a house with so many restrictive rules. You’re not allowed books! Come on!). The story is entertaining with an impressive number of twists to keep you guessing. When it comes to uncovering who was responsible for Emma’s death, there are enough plausible suspects to keep you intrigued.On the whole it’s easy to read, although the dialogue in Emma’s chapters isn’t marked off by inverted commas, which can slow the pace down as you try to separate speech from thought.And, if you like creepy, this book delivers it in spades. As the story alternates between “Emma chapters” in the past and “Jane chapters” in the present, the parallels between the women’s experiences are gradually revealed and the similarities at times, particularly in their relationships with Edward, made me shudder.However, I have issues with the sexual politics of a story in which the two main characters are largely ok with having a narcissist trying to control them. I can’t really say more than that because it could be giving away some major plot points (sorry!).I also felt things started to go haywire in the last quarter of the book as the twisting and turning went too far, pushing the plot from far-fetched to ridiculous. So while I wasn’t bored for a single second while reading The Girl Before, I have to confess to a fair bit of tutting and eye-rolling.Overall: fans of creepy psychological thrillers will love The Girl Before. I’m sure it will be very successful and I look forward to seeing how closely the upcoming film adaptation sticks to the book.Thank you to Quercus Books and NetGalley for the e-ARC."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.396119"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.396119"]]

Hier habe ich mir eine spannende und ereignisreiche Geschichte erhofft und diese auch größtenteils erhalten.Ich muss gestehen, dass ich anfangs ein paar Probleme mit der Geschichte hatte, denn der Anfang war doch sehr zäh, sodass ich mich auf den ersten 50-75 Seiten ganz schön durchbeißen musste. Danach konnte mich die Geschichte jedoch immer mehr packen, sodass ich letztendlich doch eine spannende Geschichte vorgefunden habe.Erzählt wird hierbei die Geschichte von Jane, die es im Leben nicht immer leicht hatte und von daher dringend einen Tapetenwechsel benötigt. Das Glück steht ihr dabei auf der Seite, denn sie darf in ein modernes Haus in einem angesehenen Stadtteil in London ziehen. Als sie dazu noch Edward kennen lernt, dem das Haus gehört, scheint ihr Glück zunächst perfekt zu sein, denn sie beginnt eine Affäre mit ihm und glaubt, dass ihr Leben nun besser wird. Dieses Leben beginnt jedoch immer mehr zu bröckeln, als Jane erfährt, dass es bereits eine andere Frau in diesem Haus gab, die ihr nicht nur sehr ähnlich sah, sondern dazu in dem Haus verstorben ist. Dabei kommt es auch immer zu Erlebnissen aus der Vergangenheit aus der Sicht von Emma, die in dem Haus verstorben ist.Die Geschichte ist trotz kleinerer Schwächen stets spannend. Zwar gibt es auch hier die ruhigeren Momente, die sich stellenweise ein wenig ziehen, allerdings erlebt man hier insgesamt eine interessante Geschichte mit vielseitigen Figuren, die zwar nicht immer sympathisch sind, in die man sich aber dennoch in gewisser Art und Weise hineinversetzen kann. Das Cover passt gut zur Geschichte, gleichzeitig erkennt man auch direkt das Genre und eine düstere Stimmung, was ebenfalls gut zur Geschichte passt. Die Kurzbeschreibung liest sich spannend und hat direkt mein Interesse geweckt, sodass ich \"The Girl Before\" sehr gerne eine Chance gegeben habe.Kurz gesagt: \"The Girl Before\" ist ein interessanter und spannender Thriller mit vielseitigen Figuren, der zwar am Anfang seine Zeit braucht und auch um kleinere Längen nicht herumkommt, mich aber letztendlich dennoch überzeugen konnte, sodass ich das Buch gerne gelesen haben. Wer bereits Bücher von Paula Hawkins mochte, sollte auch JP Delaney eine Chance geben!

The book tells the story of Emma and Jane, both tenants at One Folgate Street, a house that is a minimalist's and architect's dream. The house was designed by famed architect Edward Monkton. He still owns the house but rents it out to people he deems worthy. Prospective tenants have to complete a questionnaire, a personal interview, and agree to the 200 rules he imposes. Despite all the restrictions, he manages to find people who want to live there.The book alternates points of view, and chapters, between Emma and Jane. Emma is the past tenant, Jane is the current one. There are similarities between the two women. Both are victims of recent tragedies. Emma is traumatized by a recent break-in at her home that occurred while she was there. Jane by the still birth of her first child. Both women are looking for a fresh start and feel that One Folgate Street can provide that.We learn early on that Emma died in the house. It is unsure if the death was an accident, a suicide or murder. When Jane learns of Emma's death, she begins to investigate it. The alternating chapters really hi-light the similarities between Emma and Jane's experiences in the house. Seeing them making some of the same choices, really increases the tension. This book is a psychological thriller. Between Edward's increasingly controlling behavior, and what we learn about Emma and Jane's lives, the reader just doesn't know what to think. Did Edward kill Emma? Is Jane now in danger from him? Or was someone else to blame? We don't find out what actually happens until the very end.I thought this was an enjoyable book. It was fun and easy to read. The chapters were all short and fast paced. I would recommend this book to my friends who are looking for a nice escapist read.I received a free ARC from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.405855"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.405855"]]

One ended up dead and the other one who comes after her is determined to find out the truth.Sounds interesting? Yes it really is. I was really mesmerized by Edward the mysterious architect. He is possibly a psycho and I am tense waiting for the big reveleation in which he finally reveal his true self. Also this is told by the alternating POVs of Emma and Jane. We gotta read the events leading up to Emma's death. The whole story was pretty good up until that ending. Nothing really explains and I don't even understand how it all happens(view spoiler)[ What is Edward's deal? why he gotta repeat the same events with 2 different woman?What is the purpose of this house?Those are the questions been bugging me. It seems like Edward's character is merely a distraction or a decoration  (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.408448"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.408448"]]

Emma is the past resident of the house and Jane is the current resident. It was a great way to present the story.-The ending was a real surprise but it was plausible - I realized that I had missed some clues along the way.What I didn't Like - There was too much unneeded sex.-I am so tired of book titles with the word GIRLS in them when the characters are actually WOMEN.Overall, I thought it was a great read and I definitely enjoyed it.Thanks to Book Browse for a copy of this book.

Emma and Jane are two damaged women who are both separately searching for a home that will provide them with the qualities they are desperately seeking: security, safety, and peace. They find it at One Folgate Street. This story is told in two different POVs: one by Jane and the other by Emma. One of them is living in the present and the other in the past. One is still alive and the other is dead. Their reasons for searching for a peaceful, quiet and minimalist location to live in may be different, but have caused them great pain. The one thing they do share is who they fall in love with. Enigmatic, mysterious and alpha-male Edward is what most women tend to fantasize about. Edward is intelligent, successful and handsome. He lives an incredibly strict and innately detailed lifestyle. Those he chooses as tenants to live at One Folgate Street need to abide by his stringent and lengthy contract. There are very few who would be willing to give everything up to live there, but for Emma and Jane it's exactly what they're looking for.As time goes on, the beautiful and pristine home can't keep them blinded from the truth forever. As time goes on, they begin to suspect that underneath that immaculate exterior lies a secret so dark and deadly that it may cost them their lives. This was a great story! I usually love reading books that are very fast paced, but I had no problem getting absorbed into this novel. I found it to be enthralling with just the right amount of suspense and character growth.

Part of me liked it very much, a big part. But I've got some niggles with it, and in writing this review, it might help me understand my feels a bit.LikedThe state-of-the-art home where our two protagonists lived. It was a breathtakingly impressive place, which had all the gizmos and gadgets cleverly hidden away to create a perfect minimalistic living space. I'd have to break some rules to live there though. Books and cushions.Characters with unlikable traits. Yeah, I do like that. I enjoy their flawed and twisted personas and trying to fathom them out. The subtle hint of kink. Yep, these were not vanilla folk. The author brought just enough to give it some sizzle, without too much detail. Some things are best left to the readers imagination. Learning about Japanese cuisine. There's far more to it than sushi and friggin hot wasabi. (See also 'Disliked')How the two MC's POV's and stories merged as the story progressed.DislikedThe first 30-40%. I just couldn't get to grips with it! Those two girls, both with simple names, Jane and Emma. I couldn't for the life of me distinguish between them initially. I resorted to having a scrap of paper by my side whilst reading, with 'Jane, - present, Emma, - past' scribbled on it so I knew whose voice I was hearing. It's mad, it could of been just me, but I really had issues with those names. Both four letters, both very British, both rather samey. I dunno. *shrugs*It had a half-way-through-major-eyeball-rolling-moment. It was predictable and typical.Learning about Japanese cuisine. Urghhhh! Is that shit for real? No way. Nope. Stay away from my mouth.So, my conclusion is, that, yes, it was a unique story experience, with twists that kept me engrossed until the end, but it wasn't sensational.Thank you to NetGalley and Quercus Books for the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.451756"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.451756"]]

One Folgate Street was originally going to be built to be the family home of world famous architect, Edward Monkford but when his wife and child are killed, he rips up the plans and designs a unique house that molds the renter fit the house. There is an almost impossible list of questions and stipulations that must be agreed to by the prospective renter and even then it has to be approved by Edward Monkford. What first attracts people is the price. It is extremely reasonable and once they get used to the seeming austerity of the house, the beauty.The first renter in the book is Emma and her boyfriend Simon. They have just had a break-in at their current apartment that has left Emma fearful for her safety. Emma has found security problems at all the other apartments they have seen. One Folgate Street offers total security. To enter or use anything in the place they must wear a band that lets the place know you belong there. The sensors built into the house operate everything. Emma and Simon fall in love with the place and they apparently answered the questions satisfactorily as Edward Monkford approves their application. But soon after they move in, it becomes only Emma. Simon is thrown out of the picture and I believe it is mainly to do with Emma's initial attraction to Edward.The Girl Before fluctuates between Emma and Jane. The current resident is Jane and Emma is the girl before but we only learns what happened to Emma and what is happening to Jane as both their stories unfold. What happens to Jane has a lot to do with her curiosity about what happened to Emma. Both of them are wounded souls, Emma because of the break-in and Jane because of a stillborn baby.Both become intimately involved with Edward. He is very handsome, mysterious and domineering. Emma wants a man to take charge of her. She looks back on Simon as being too meek. She wants a man to dominate and protect her. She finds Edward all to willing to fill that role but he makes it very clear that he believes in short term intense relationships. Emma, like many women in relationships, believes that she will be the one to change her man. Unfortunately Emma seems to find lying easier than telling the truth and her lies start unravelling and so does her life.At one point in this book I consider putting it aside because Edward is coming across as super creepy. I decide to continue further and I'm glad I did. The book takes hold of me and pulls me in to the point where I have a hard time putting it down.Jane comes to live at One Folgate Street after the her stillborn birth of her daughter Isobel. She is vulnerable and Edward sees that and they too begin an affair. I don't understand why all these women are drawn to Edward Monkford. Too me he just comes across as creepy and the book wants you to see him as the villain of the story. Jane agrees to all of the demands asked of her to live in the house but her character is stronger than Emma's. She has noticed the similarity of Edward's deceased wife, Emma and herself. She starts investigating what happened to Emma but to keep what she's doing a secret from the house, Jane must go to a corner of her bedroom so she can use the neighbor's WiFi.In the end she survives an encounter with an unsuspected danger and proves that she was using Edward as he was using her. I am very glad that I continued reading through to the end.In the author's write up JP Delaney is revealed to be the pen names for someone who is already successful under possibly 2 different names. I thought of Nora Roberts with her JD Robb series or JK Rowling with her Cormoran Strike mysteries. It will most likely come out eventually but it is a neat twist.I received this book as a member of Suzanne Beecher's First Look Book Club and courtesy of Penguin Random House and I have given my honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.495784"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.495784"]]

In other words, I loved it. In a strange and twisted way. Just like everything is in this novel. It starts with an absurd concept, and you think, it can't get any worse but it does. Oh dear, it does. It crawls under your skin, shakes your bones, makes you sick in the night. It's messed up. In an eerie and beautiful way. Moreover, The Girl Before raises many controversial questions of the 21st century. This novel challenges you in every possible way. First, it makes you write the list of all of your essential possessions. Emphasis on essential. So, cross out that eyeliner and fuzzy slippers. Then, it makes you live in the house where 95% of people before haven't even lasted longer than a couple weeks. The house is indeed an architectural masterpiece created with a purpose of changing the resident. It's so sterile, you feel like a blank canvas - ready for a new start. And the house will either force you to start over or force you out. One Folgate Street's goal is to make your physical and emotional well-being better. That is the first question The Girl Before brings you to, shall architects create \"buildings with a sense of purpose?\"Second, it makes you a subject to a house. One Folgate Street is an amazing creation. I was absolutely fascinated by a house that monitors health and well-being of the tenant. The house is equipped with all sorts of sensors, therefore creating the most pleasant environment. The lights, the temperature, the water, the AC, the appliances - the house adjusts everything up to tenant's physical and emotional parameters. It's insane. It's beautiful. It's genius. It's future. That brings you to the second question, would collection of physical and emotional parameters with the goal of general improvement cause the conflict between privacy and technology? Third, it makes you reconsider your social choices. Because, honestly, what is going on in The Girl Before is equally messed up to Gone Girl. I am not exaggerating. It's like ice-cold water in the face, a wake-up call, a horrible realization, a gun to the head. Who do you trust? Who do you lie to? Who lies to you? All and no one. Everyone is this book is goddamn insane but so bloody real. Personalities are amplified, yes, but, honey, they are real. And they make you wonder, to what extent actions can be justified by love? I read The Girl Before on my trip to New Orleans at night. This made the reading experience even creepier. I was not able to close my eyes until the next day, and this heavy feeling was gnawing upon me the entire day. I finished the novel over three weeks ago but I still can't stop thinking about it and the residents of One Folgate Street. I feel haunted. I feel heartbroken.

The focus moves between the lives and experiences of Emma Matthews (‘Then’) and Jane Cavendish (‘Now’) at One Folgate Street in London, UK. One Folgate Street is a minimalist house designed by a reclusive architect, Edward Monkford. Those who seek to live there need to fill in a lengthy application form, and will need to abide by some 200 conditions stipulated under a restrictive covenant if their application is approved. Very few applicants are approved.‘It’s an extraordinarily tight contract.’Then: Emma Matthews likes One Folgate Place: she feels safe there. After a burglary in her last place, she is looking for security. Emma and her boyfriend Simon move in.Now: Jane Cavendish is looking for a new home. Somewhere to recover after the sudden death of her baby daughter just days before her birth.The novel shifts between ‘Then’ and ‘Now’, between Emma and Jane. Clearly Emma and Simon are no longer living at One Folgate Street when Jane moves in. But when Jane discovers that Emma died at One Folgate Street, she becomes curious about the girl who lived there before her.‘It seems One Folgate Street has a somewhat tragic history, he says.’So, what happened to Emma Matthews and her boyfriend Simon? Why are the tenancy rules so inflexible for One Folgate Street? Who is Edward Monkford, and why has he designed One Folgate Street in such a controlled, minimalist fashion? You’ll need to read the book to try to find the answers to these questions The more pages I turned, the more I became caught up in the story. My own brief obsession (I read the novel over two days) was to find out what had happened to Emma. While there are many disturbing similarities between Emma’s story and Jane’s, there are some significant differences. And just when I thought I’d worked out what happened to Emma, another twist would have me looking in another direction. It’s claustrophobic and obsessive, and I can understand why Universal has bought the film rights.Did I enjoy this novel? Yes, mostly. I had envisaged a slightly different ending, but I’m not disappointed. I’d like to know more about the author, though: J.P. Delaney is, apparently, a pseudonym for an author who has ‘previously written bestselling fiction under other names’.Note: My thanks to Hachette Australia and NetGalley for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.506781"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.506781"]]

My thanks to the author and his/her publisher.Has anyone else noticed that there are a slew of books in the past few years that have included the “Girl…” in their titles? The 'Girl' In The Title: More Than A Marketing TrendHere's a trend in new books: Publishers commonly promote them by comparing them to other books — and when the books are crime fiction or thrillers, and written by women, they get compared to the same books again and again and again.

Of course, there were a few things I didn’t like so much:•\\tFirstly, there were several 2 page chapters. There needed to be more space and development between alternating points of view. I am not an idiot; I can remember similar occurrences that happened between the two girls and Edward without it having to be repeated hard on the heels of each other.•\\tI would have liked the relationship between Emma and her psychiatrist to have been developed a bit more.

Especially if they're lackluster (though I do admit that I wasn't all that impressed with Gone Girl and it's my least favorite Flynn novel). This is my fault, really. I hate that mystery books are all compared to GG and GOTT, but I still pick them up, even though I've been burned time and time again. Unfortunately for me, The Girl Before was yet another burn.The Girl Before tries to be this edgy, steamy thriller that has shades of GG and 50 Shades of Grey. The thing is that it fails in every conceivable way. Mind you, I haven't read 50 Shades of Grey (and will never, ever read it due to how it seems to fetishize controlling behavior), but The Girl Before seems to have tried to captivate the same kind of steaminess (or rather try to captivate the people who considered FSOG steamy and not just icky w/ it's control factor). But it's not steamy, it's icky. And it's not edgy, it's just the same predictable mess that's come from all of the other GG wannabes.My main issue with The Girl Before is that the women are stupid. The main characters fall under the \"stupid characters do stupid, stupid things\" category. The Emma chapters were just a mess. Pretty much the author trying to throw everything, but the kitchen sink in there. They were so implausible (and that whole \"Daddy\" thing? Icky as fuck). And what was with writing the Emma chapters without quotation marks? Was it to differentiate the Emma chapters from the Jane chapters? Well, it worked. Cause I differentiated them by thinking, \"Oh, here are the Jane chapters and here are the pretentious, special snowflake without quotation marks chapters.\" It was so annoying and so unnecessary.Jane was no better. If Emma was pathetic, Jane was ten times worse. She gets all this evidence that Edward might not be a good dude and she constantly ignores it. She doesn't want to take anything those people tell her at face value, but has no problem taking what Edward tells her at face value. In fact, she's so pathetic that she wonders why all these guys are obsessed with Emma, while simultaneously lamenting that no one is obsessed with her. Really? You're upset because no one seems to be stalking you? Go home, Jane. You're drunk. So what does The Girl Before have going for it? It's a page-turner. That's it. Besides that, it's a mess. It's predictable, the least unique book you'll ever read, and full of unlikable characters who deserve to get hit by trains.

When I’d put down the book and pick it up a few hours later, I couldn’t remember which event/thing happened to which girl, because the story-lines were too similar. The whole book was too disjointed, simply because the two P.O.V. were too much alike.And what really bothered me about Emma’s chapters were the absence of quotation marks. I completely loath when writers feel the need to do this. Half the time, you can’t even tell who’s talking in Emma’s chapters, because, like I stated, there are no quotation marks. It was a big guessing game: Are these Emma’s thoughts, or is she speaking out loud? It’s such a headache to read a story with dialogue that breaks one of the most important rules of grammar. The lack of “” was distracting to the story and very off putting. \\tThe writing itself was sort of dry. A lot of “says…insert adverb here (drily, tartly, etc)” \\tI also found bits of this story to be too far-fetched. I don’t care how fancy or nice a house like One Folgate Street is, no one in their right mind would live in a place with so many rules and restrictions. I mean, no furniture? No books? Although, as much as I’d like to say the technology inside the house was teetering on the edge of science fiction, it really wasn’t. I can see variations of smart houses like One Folgate Street popping up in the future. \\tThis book did have its creepy moments, but it wasn’t exactly thriller or hair raising if you know what I mean. Yes, the house was eerie, but it wasn’t scary. \\tOn a good note, there were a couple twists and turns within the story that surprised me, and this really is a book you don’t want to put down. And, I did get The Girl on the Train vibe towards the second half of the novel which is always a good thing. \\tThank you to NetGalley/the publisher for this ARC. This is my honest, unbiased review!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.515004"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.515004"]]

I love books that have a resolved ending that leaves me feeling satisfied about the outcome. :DThe Girl Before follows the story of Emma (in the past) and Jane (in the present). It's a story about a house (One Folgate Street) that is a perfect home for people who want a nice house but can't afford an expensive one. But why is it so cheap? The one condition to purchasing this home is that you have to agree follow The Rules and be accepted after a strict application process, which most people don't pass.Emma is looking for a new start after her and her boyfriend's apartment was violently broken into while she was home alone. A little further in the future, Jane suffers the death of her perfect baby girl and wants to start over in a new home that doesn't remind her of the baby. Neither one of them can afford an expensive home, and they both are amazed by the simplicity and minimalist style of One Folgate Street. To apply for the house, the women fill out a long questionnaire with seemingly odd and sometimes personal questions and send photos of themselves along with it. Both of them send in their applications and receive an interview with Edward Monkford, the architect of the home. Monkford is gorgeous but controlling, and both women are drawn to him.Soon after she moves in, Jane finds out that the woman who lived in the house before her (Emma) had died under strange circumstances. She also finds out that she bears a striking resemblance to Emma - and to Monkford's late wife. Jane becomes obsessed with Emma's story and finding out what happened to her. I don't want to ruin anything so I'll stop there!The writing was very well thought-out and I really liked the way that it was told. The alternating chapters of Emma's POV (in the past) and Jane's POV (in the present) fit together really well. I thought that it was full of suspense and the ending was definitely not expected. Also, readers will never guess who \"the girl before\" is. I thought I had it figured out early on but I was wrong. The whole book was brilliant, in my opinion.Copy provided by Netgalley for a review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.537681"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.537681"]]

Yes it did - I raced through it in two days.One Folgate Street in London, England, is a architectural wonder. It is minimalism to the extreme. Stone, glass, white on white, no doors. And much is controlled by the Housekeeper - a computer program that takes its cues from the bracelet that the inhabitants wear.And who lives there? Only those chosen by the architect - after undergoing a rigorous application. And acceptance of the many rules of the house - no mess everything must be out of sight, no photos, no colour and much more.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"After a break-in, Emma see living in the house as safe, a sanctuary against danger. After her divorce, Jane sees the house as a clean slate, a new start. Emma lived at Folgate before Jane.The Girl Before is told in alternating chapters from Jane and Emma - now and then. When Jane learns of the previous tenant's death, she becomes consumed with finding out more - even though she is discouraged by the enigmatic Edward, the architect/owner. The reader is privy to the events during Emma's time in the house. And knowing what we know, the tension ratchets up as Jane seems to be following in her footsteps - and into danger......I felt like I should be on Emma and Jane's 'side', if you will. But as the book progressed and more of their personalities and their (questionable) choices are revealed, I found I didn't overly like either of them. But I still desperately wanted to know what next. Edward - well, he's in his own category. And I'm not too sure why either of them find him so appealing, but hey, this book wouldn't be the same without him being this way. Control, it's all about control with this guy. In his life and in his house. Super creepy.Gentle readers be warned - there are a few somewhat graphic sex scenes.Just get yourself past accepting that anyone would actually move into a house such as this with crazy rules and you are in for a deliriously addictive, psychologically twisty turny read with a nice little gotcha in the end."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.540860"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.540860"]]

Can architecture make social and personal interventions? These questions get raised but are ultimately subsumed beneath a pretty standard 'psychological' thriller: characters are damaged, pathological liars, psychopaths hidden in plain sight, and obsessive-compulsives with a bit of sexual exhibitionism thrown in for good measure and a couple of murders.The writing is smoother than is often the case in this kind of commercial fiction: the sections are very short, sometimes only half a page, at most a couple of pages, switching between Emma 'then' and Jane 'now'. There's lots of misdirection going on but personally I feel it's cheating to have twists that depend on 1st person narrators simply lying to us...So an enjoyable piece of fluff that I whizzed through in one sitting: I'd like to see Delaney do something more intelligent with the intriguing ideas that get suggested here but which ultimately have little to do with the plot.

This is a pseudonym for an author who has already published fiction under another name and you could tell that this wasn’t their first rodeo so to speak.The Girl Before is a psychological thriller that will have you guessing from the get go as the present and the past go on an eerily similar journey. This story is told in two point of views, Emma (The Girl Before) and Jane the present. Emma took up residency at One Folgate Street after an aggravated burglary left her with a crippling fear of living in her old house. The new house had to be high security to give her that “safe” feeling and One Folgate Street was the only property that fitted the bill. One Folgate Street was the brainchild of top architect, Edward Monkford and was as high spec as they came and extremely minimalist. Only tenants willing to go through an intense veto process and adhere to some two hundred rules could live there and that meant giving up everything that you didn’t need, living with the bare necessities and living clean and tidy. The house had a brain as it were and monitored the residents, adapting to their day to day routines, their preferences and their dislikes. It was a social experiment of sorts and one that the residents knew they were a part of, hence the affordable rent for an otherwise unobtainable property. \n  \n    “You can make your surroundings as polished and empty as you like. But it doesn’t really matter if you’re still messed up inside.”\n  \nJane is the current resident of One Folgate Street and is currently coming to terms with losing a child and One Folgate Street is her clean break and fresh start. Jane fell in love with the property and is immediately taken by its creator but it is not long before the walls begin to bleed their secrets. Once Jane becomes aware of the tragic past of the property she takes it upon herself to investigate…with startling revelations. Will the present mimic the past? \n  \n    “There was a time when One Folgate Street seemed like a calm, serene haven. Now it doesn’t. It feels claustrophobic and aggressive. Like the house is angry with me.”\n  \nI will say that because Emma and Jane’s stories were so startling similar at times, it did become hard to keep track of whose point of view I was currently reading. I found myself flipping back to the beginning of chapters when the characters began to blur. I did notice that Emma’s point of view did not contain any speech marks, if this was a way of differentiating between the two it didn’t work for me, it only made reading those chapters a tad confusing. It may be that there was a different method behind this style of writing but it wasn’t immediately apparent.\n  \n    “Never apologize for someone you love, he says quietly. It makes you look like a prick.”\n  \nThis was an addictive read though, one that I couldn’t put down. JP Delaney cleverly built this story, slowly peeling back his characters like the layers of an onion. As each layer is removed the character’s secrets became fewer, the truth more apparent and I was anxiously waiting to reach the centre. With each chapter, the more engrossed I became and while the beginning is a little slow to get going, it soon becomes apparent that the pacing was deliberate in its lure to totally submerse you in Emma and Jane’s story. This was a clever manipulation of the mind as your brain screams at you to believe one thing, yet your subconscious tells you another. Do you rule with your heart, head or your gut instinct?I did have a few issues with The Girl Before, hence the rating, but as psychological thrillers went this certainly held my attention from the start and left me with that constant fear of woe throughout. I did feel that the ending was rushed and did not feel any particular closure with Edward and Jane and while I could see where the author wanted to go at the end, its delivery let it down. While this book does stretch your imagination at times, I am sure that someone, somewhere has already invented a house like this, whether I would want to be a part of it…hell no and I did find myself struggling to come to terms with the residents willing participation. Sometimes though the allure of grandeur knocks all common sense from people and picking on an already vulnerable person was probably the kick starter to garner anyone’s interest. However, it was gripping, it had my mind running a mile a minute, even taking notes as I tried to decipher fact from fiction, truth from lies and throw those red herrings overboard. I am usually wrong, I would be a crap detective but I did get this one right.\n  \n    “I built something as simple as a mausoleum because that was how I felt at the time. But then I realised that in my madness I’d inadvertently created something extraordinary. A house that would demand a sacrifice from anyone who lived there, but which would repay that sacrifice a thousand-fold. There are some it destroys… But some it makes stronger.”\n  \nThis is soon to become a film, I can see the allure and personally cannot wait to see how this is depicted on the big screen.www.theromancecover.com"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.559915"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.559915"]]

But in this case, there were moments where I genuinely felt like I was reading a  Gone Girl rip-off. There were other moments that felt like a carbon copy of  The Girl on the Train. And, because apparently we needed to make matters even worse, this book also felt like it had healthy dashes of  Fifty Shades of Grey thrown in there. Cue me throwing up.What is this book about? Two women, separated by a couple years, going through the same process of moving into a new home and starting affairs with the architect who built it. His house comes with hundreds of rules to ensure that every detail of the tenant's life is like something out of a wet dream of Marie Kondo. His relationships come with just as many regulations. I think the point where I wanted to throw the book across the room in disgust was when this man told one of his lovers that she should groom her pubic hair because it wasn't perfectly symmetrical....but there were a million things just like this. He was possibly the most vomit-inducing love interest I have ever read about. Having to witness not one but TWO women fall for this guy was torturous. The two timelines have so many similarities IT IS LIKE READING THE EXACT SAME BOOK TWICE. WHY.The ~mystery~ aspect was lacking. I felt like J.P Delaney was trying desperately hard to cram in as many shocking moments as possible but it wasn't done in any sort of original way so I could predict everything because it was all so overdone. And this is coming from someone who rarely reads thrillers. I felt like so many of the reveals just involved a character turning out to be some sort of general \"crazy person.\" This is not only boring but also just offensive. Some of the most intense moments of the book were actually cartoonishly ridiculous to me. There's a plotline about rape that I found EXTREMELY disappointing and absolutely unforgivable. If this is something you're sensitive about, I recommend skipping this book completely but I'll add a spoiler about this in case you need it: (view spoiler)[Basically, it's very triggering and graphic and then it turns out that the rape allegations were completely false. The protagonist actually accuses two separate men of raping her and then two OTHER men of abusing her. The abuse is pretty minor compared to the rape in terms of attention in the plot. But yeah. It's all absolutely shitty. I have very low tolerance for false rape allegations in fiction.

The mutual setting is an unusual apartment - one that is a living model of high architecture - designed by an enigmatic architect. Emma and Jane narrate two different narratives that bring them to live at this unusual residence at separate times. While different circumstances brought them to their new home, their lives share similarities - particularly as they abide by the stringent rules set by the architect - and later by their relationship with the architect himself. Both women, too, are haunted by the titular girl before - in Emma's case, she becomes obsessed with the first wife of the architect, while Jane becomes obsessed with Emma.The chapters alternate between the two women and the similarities (and later, the differences) really amplifies the tension. As echoes of the two women's lives ring out across the whole, it really makes this an absorbing read. The plot moves along at a fast pace and does involve more surprises to the plot than I expected. At first, the book really feels like a straightforward read and each woman's actions and investigations adds complexity to the plot and their characters. Jane's section in particular has a tragic backstory, that may be a bit too sad for some readers. But, overall, it is an exciting and engaging read. The conclusion fits nicely, too.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jan 26, 2017"], ["review_text", "When choosing a book to read I often follow my gut feeling, especially when it comes to the authors that I don't know - although JP Delaney is a pen name for a best - selling author, and when reading \"The Girl Before\" I was looking for any hallmarks but I didn't guess the real name - and when spotting this book I just had a feeling that this could be THE read. And well, yes, it turned out that I should trust my gut feeling as the book was totally engrossing and kept me glued to the pages. \"The Girl Before\" was a provocative, incredibly smart story about controlling and manipulations, making reader to ask who is reliable there and whom shall we trust.Now. \"The Girl Before\". We can start debating who the hell would go and live voluntarily in a house with 200 stipulations including no pets (no way), no children, no cushions, no curtains, no personal things on the floor, no books (hello?). And yet they signed on the dotted line. The house itself is an example of minimalism and the latest and best home technology, adjusting itself to the weather, temperature and probably the mood of the inhabitants. Originally designed by Edward Monkton as his family home but there was an accident on the site when his wife and his young son died. Also, he is the one who, after interviewing the prospective renters, is to decide if they're going to live there or not. Weird, no? Who in their right mind would go for something like this? I wouldn't, and I don't want to go into this debate, but I thought that it is a brilliant and unique idea and premise for a book. For me the book sounded unique, not like others books that I read, and the only thing that didn't work so good for me was the end, that sounded too Disney-like and somehow didn't sit with the book. However, this is probably the only thing that I'm going to criticise. There were maybe some things that made me feel uncomfortable, just like building the house on the grave or some scenes with abuse - both human and animal - but nothing that would make me cringe.The story alternates between Emma (Then) and Jane (Now), and the chapters were short and dynamic and it also made the story flow and reading much quicker. It was also the writing that makes this book so outstanding. It is sparse, but it is incredibly hooking and just beautiful - we can say just like the house! It just feels like the house, to be honest, white and with no barriers or unnecessary things and beautiful in its frugality. The way the stories of Emma and Jane mirrored made me feel a little claustrophobic and insecure, to be honest, it brought a lot of tension and changed my perspective more than once.I loved how the story was divided between the two points of view. Both of them were in the first person but I've never had a problem to see who's speaking. Duh, the chapters did have titles with the name of the characters! I also liked the way both stories were interwoven and how quickly and effortlessly they picked up when the other has just finished. Really, as the chapters flip back and forth the similarities between the women and their lives started to feel suspicious and somehow creepy, and it was obvious that eventually I'll start to suspect Edward as well.I think the characters there are not created to be liked by the readers. Their decisions didn't help to warm to them, and it is not that I had problems with the characters but I did think that both the women, Emma and Jane, were incredibly naive. There were thousands of warning bells that they chose to ignore and the way they meekly agreed to be controlled by both house and Edward was remarkable and odd. I mean, allowing a man to control your diet and exercise? No, thank you. It was even more surprising that they were like lambs because they were both relatively troubled women and they should know better.The house on One Folgate was like a living and breathing character itself, to be honest. I really started to believe that the house is trying to destroy the ones it doesn't approve of, that it controls the lives. It was truly extraordinary how the author managed to create this special, claustrophobic atmosphere of this place.It is not a book that is destined to make you scared or look over your shoulder. It is a book that is destined to make you feel tension and suspense, keep you in the dark and play with your mind. It is a slow burner, this novel, but with this kind of book it shouldn't be different - well, you can't expect the biggest twist to be explained on the first pages, right. No, you're expecting it to grow slowly in tension, to change tracks, to pull wool over your eyes, and \"The Girl Before\" just does it. However, as the circle of suspects was very limited in the novel, the end didn't come as such a BIG surprise, although the last quarter of the story truly meddled with my mind and made me change my opinion about some characters.Because of the slow pace it takes some time for the book to really pick up, and it happens when Jane discovers that someone died in the house before, and it also takes time for Emma to start to feel afraid. However, even with it taking time, for me it was engaging, interesting and unusual read. The way the story developed was very masterfully and skilfully plotted and organized and I absolutely admired this feeling of dread that the author smuggled onto the pages.This is a story about secrets, lies and appearances that can often be deceiving. It is one huge rollercoaster ride full of ups and downs and there was something very special in it and I didn't want to put it down. It is an engrossing mystery, even if the characters are not too likeable - but they don't have to be in this kind of story. It is good enough that they are multi - layered, they are very complex and I think that no matter what, we never know if they're telling the truth or if they're hiding something. It was a thought - provoking, addictive and a clever read, multi - layered with many surprises and I highly recommend \"The Girl Before\" to you.Copy provided by the publisher in return for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.595998"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.595998"]]

But I almost think it does a disservice to the book they're trying to get me to read. So I almost avoided this. Alas, the actual description here on Netgalley was so riveting I requested it, and I'm thrilled that I did (no pun intended)! I want to read a book because YOU think it's great, not because it's just like someone else's book (I didn't even like The Girl On The Train. Rachel was far too pathetic for my taste.)Now THIS... this was an innovative spin on those other psychological novels. The house itself became a character. I actually wish that was explored more. I loved the way all of the characters developed here. (view spoiler)[ There were a couple of 'wait what?!\" moments that threw me off that I fully intended on writing here like 'why would she uh, slob his knob when the burglars forced her to do that exact thing to them? Why not just have sex. But you know... that was taken care of.My huge qualm was that the ending felt like the author was like 'Welp, why don't we just go ahead and make everyone a psycho. Even though house. He's a psycho! She's a psycho! Everyonesssss a psycho!!!! It felt a bit cop out. Also, Edward was much too precise through the book for him to just be like 'let's get rid of that and make a new one of our own' about the baby. The way it was written he sounded like a child having a tantrum and it was disappointing to see his character make that jump.Then when she said she had a surprise of her own... that she had planned the baby. No. What? No! (that was me when i read that) I thought she was going to say the baby didn't have downs and she was just testing him. If it was part of her plan it should have been something the reader was aware of. There were enough surprises at the end that it would have served us readers better. WE would have wanted to believe Edward was good when she was trying to find out who killed Emma. We would have been championing him WITH her and even MORE torn about him being the possible killer.That being said, it was still a great and riveting book. And the ending happened so quickly that I can forget it and just act like it ended my way. LOL!

I'm also excited to learn there will be a movie adaptation coming out, directed by Ron Howard, which is impressive in its own right especially considering the book won't be officially released until next month so apparently someone has faith in its success and I don't disagree. The Girl Before was a fast-paced, psychological, thriller that alternates point of view and narration between Jane Cavendish, in present tense, and Emma Matthews, a previous resident of the house Jane is now renting who died tragically at the residence under suspicious circumstances. Both women find common ground at One Folegate Street, an architectural wonder, designed, owned and dictated by Edward Monkford but aside from that and their striking physical resemblance the two women have little in common. Emma is deceitful and manipulative and dishonest to the core, where Jane is good hearted and well meaning, trying to recover from a recent still birth and uncover the history of the home she now lives in and the mysterious deaths of several of its former inhabitants. The home itself comes with many rules and regulations that the renter must agree to and follow under strict supervision of Edward Monkford. In a way this reminds me loosely of Fifty Shades of Grey even though I didn't like the Fifty Shades Trilogy at all and I thorough enjoyed The Girl Before, however there were definitely similarities. The dynamic between Edward and the women in his life for one, his narcissistic personality, his obsessive compulsive tendencies and need for absolute control, to name a few. I really liked the contrast between Jane and Emma. J.P. Delaney did a great job creating realistic, three dimensional characters and I found it was easy to become invested in them because they were so real, despite their character flaws. This was an ending that I didn't see coming, in more than one way actually, and that's something that I considered absolutely necessary in a good thriller. I will say that I found myself a bit disappointed at the very end. (view spoiler)[**spoiler alert** I don't want to say too much but I personally wasn't pleased with the choice Jane made at the very end. Perhaps it was the noble thing to do, however, if Edward had given me the same choice if I were in Jane's shoes I am quite confident I would have gone in the opposite direction then Jane went and I was hoping she'd do the same. I don't want to give to much away so I'll leave it at that.I read a lot of books from this genre and I can honestly say this one can hold its own amongst the vast competition out there and I'd definitely recommend it and look forward to seeing the movie version when it comes out.

Are you good enough for the house? What sacrifices can you make if you want to live here?

No things on the floor, no pictures on the wall, no pets, no kids, no curtains, no rugs, and much more. The house should always be open to tours and architects, and you will be required to submit to impromptu questions about yourself or certain parts of the electrical system will shut down.

Emma seems similar to Jane, which sends Jane on a mission to find out what happened. he mysterious death is just the beginning.This was a really quick read for me. I found myself really liking both Emma and Jane. There were pretty similar sounding at first, but as the story went on things changed. Neither of these girls is really likeable, although I did feel really sorry for Jane. The love interest for both of these women was horrible.

He would have had to be more than just good-looking to be worth all the trouble.The house has some really cool features and I loved learning about them all. An app on your phone can control the house, which is nothing really new. This house also learns from you and will remember things like what temperature you like the water in the shower to be. This house, through the app, can also tell you if you need to pick up more milk or eggs, since it can sense what is in your fridge. While all that sounds cool, I was left thinking about what a violation of privacy not having curtains, and almost certainly having cameras in the house would be.The twists were okay for me. The pacing of this story was excellent until about 60% where the characters started to show their true colors and the story started to unravel for me. It didn’t go anywhere near where I expected it. I hated almost everyone by the end of the story and felt certain the house was indeed cursed.In brighter news, I heard this was to be made into a movie directed by Ron Howard.

The character from the past is Emma. From the present, we have Jane. They have a lot in common, and it starts with them renting a house. The house is very unique. It is austere, and there is a very long list of rules that you must agree to in order to live there.Both of the girls end up in a relationship with the architect, Edward. As we weave through both of their stories, we see that their relationships are very much the same, following the same patterns as Edward asserts his dominance.Emma has a violent past. She was attacked in her old apartment where she lived with her boyfriend, Simon. They move into the new house to help Emma get over it. She and Simon soon break up.Jane's past involves a still-born daughter. She is also trying to heal. Jane finds out that Emma died in this house, and becomes somewhat obsessed with finding out how.They both find out that Edward's wife and daughter were killed while the house was being built and are forever interred in the foundation.The Girl Before is a weird story. This house is very high-tech. And between that and the rules, it seems to change the personalities of the people who live there. It's hard to explain without your reading it, and I don't want to spoil too much.Ultimately, it's a mystery about just what happened to Emma, as well as Edward's family. But the journey to these answers is very entertaining.I found the lack of quotation marks annoying. And even more annoying is at some points Delaney uses them, and then other times not. It had to do with which character was talking, but it was hard for me to adjust back and forth. I didn't see a need for this technique. In other books like this, I eventually got used to it, but with The Girl Before, it kept switching back and forth.While I was suitably surprised by the outcome, I still felt the ending needed some more punch. I was expecting a weird, exciting twist, and I just didn't get it. I would still recommend The Girl Before. I found it easy to read and very engaging. I'm not sure I would recommend this to most teens because of the sexual situations; it's definitely an adult book.Added note: the Amazon entry for this book says it's soon to be a motion picture directed by Ron Howard.

The story is told from each woman's point of view, with Emma's story being 'Then', and Jane's story being 'Now'. Emma and Jane both end up choosing to live in the same house, located at One Folgate Street. They had to jump through some unusual hoops in order to live there, however.Prior to being approved, anyone interested in living in the starkly minimalist house is required to fill out a form with some rather odd questions, and agree to live by a set of 200 rules, which includes having no books, photos, throw pillows, or anything else that is considered 'clutter' in the house. They must also include a photo of themselves, something each woman thought odd.The architect and owner of the house is a man named Edward, who originally built the house for his family. After losing his wife and son, Edward never lived there, choosing instead to rent it out for an extremely low price to anyone who was willing to live by his stringent demands.Both women become involved with Edward, and when Jane finds out that Emma—whom she closely resembles—died in the house, she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her. Was it truly an accident, or something more sinister that killed Emma? Was Edward involved? Despite being warned against it, Jane is relentless in her search for the truth, never realizing she was putting herself in danger... until it was too late.The Girl Before is a deliciously creepy psychological thriller worthy of the genre. I devoured it in a single day... I just couldn't put it down until I knew who did what, and why. There were several surprises along the way, but the last one left me so stunned, you could have knocked me over with a feather. I'm not kidding. My jaw hit the floor and I kept shaking my head in disbelief because (and I know I say this a lot) I NEVER saw it coming.Treat yourself and get a copy of this book when it hits the shelves.

(Yeah I know its a bit of a cliché) But it was true.The book is divided into two stories that ultimately involve the same house 1, Folgate Street. It tells the story of Emma who was a previous tenant and her chapters are titled Then : Emma and the current tenant Jane and her chapters are titled Now : Jane. Both their stories revolve around an enigmatic architect called Edward Monkford who has somewhat of a tragic history.Edward Monkford designed 1, Folgate Street which is the cutting edge in minimalistic living and unobtrusive technology. He has a lot of rules (at least 200) for whatever successful applicant he lets out his house to. Some of the ideas for the house are actually quite amazing but how long before an occupant would start to feel the sterile walls start to close in around them? This part of the point of the story, to have next to no personal possessions apart from the absolute essential and have the house with its own computerised system called Housekeeper. (Which is monitored by Edward) Nothing is private.Emma and Jane are two very different people who have both been through trauma and although their stories are told in the present and the past they feel like they are running together. There are divides between their chapters that ask questions with multiple choice or agree/disagree that are subjected to the tenants but can also make you think what would you do?There is a mystery surrounding what happened to Emma that Jane is determined to get to the bottom of as well as trying to find out what makes Edward tick as they start a relationship of sorts. There is much manipulation going on within the pages from most of the people in book so at times it is hard to feel sympathy for everyone as more and more is revealed. There are dark deeds at work and not everything is as it seems, which is good to have at the heart of a mysterious thriller, after all!

You have two parallel stories, both from the point of view of a different young woman. One has lost a baby at full term in a terrible birth story that I found very moving, the other has been badly mentally damaged by being the victim of a home invasion. They both at different times live in a house which is austere, minimalistic and which demands a great deal of sacrifice by those who live there. You must pass a complicated test, take regular re-testing and allow architecture students access to the house. There is a mystery surrounding the house, rumours that there was a terrible accident involving the architect's wife and that she died on the premises. The architect is an enigma, compellingly attractive but also complicated and apparently very available! The house has secrets, the architect has secrets, everyone is unreliable, nobody can be trusted.If you analysed this from a feminist perspective this is a book about abuse in lots of forms, it is a book full of characters who should have known better, who behave badly and who are a bit pathetic. I had annoyances in how the author portrayed the women, I looked up to see if this was written by a man or a woman, turns out this is a pseudonym for a man, colour me unsurprised! No woman would have written these women this way. But when you are reading it and you suspend your disbelief and cynical eye, it is a really good read. It is pacy and compelling.

The chapters alternate between Emma and Jane, past and present. Each of these young women are willing \"audition\" to rent a clinically beautiful and technologically advanced house by a famous minimalist architect. First comes a long questionnaire of odd and personal questions. Each young woman fills out the questionnaire which also requires three photos. Hmmmm. The weird questions and the photo requirement didn't set off any warning bells? If Edward Monkhouse, the architect and owner, likes the responses, then he grants an interview to decide who is appropriate for the house. Of course, both Emma and Jane get an interview. There are rules--lots of them: no books, no rugs, no personal effects, no photos, no clutter. A computer \"housekeeper\" monitors everything in the house. Both Emma and Jane are unreliable narrators and willing to surrender their personalities to fit the house and the architect. I have a thing about people who give up everything to satisfy another person or ideological belief. I know it happens, but it is almost impossible for me to imagine. It is one thing for it to happen gradually as in a Stockholm Syndrome situation or a domestic situation that develops over time as a matter of gradual reconditioning, but for an eager almost immediate surrender to someone else's dictates?

Delaney. Though lured by a strong synopsis that promised a solid mystery, I knew I was in trouble with this book early on, simply because I didn’t buy the main premise of the story. Even bearing in mind the crazy cost of London rentals, I just don’t believe that anyone would want to live at cut-price One Folgate Street, no matter how futuristically ground-breaking its design might be. Why? Because to live here pretty much means signing your whole life, including all of your possessions, away. It also means signing a contract that contains more than two-hundred clauses (I’m not exaggerating), thanks to a landlord who is, to put it mildly, a complete control freak.The landlord in question is Edward Monkford, the renowned architect who designed One Folgate Street, and now rents it out to a very select few tenants. Jane is one of these tenants, as was Emma, the ‘girl before’ of the title. The Girl Before employs a dual timeline, and it soon becomes clear that both Jane and Emma’s time at One Folgate Street follows eerily similar patterns, including the fact that both women inexplicably start to fall for the utterly charmless Monkford. The catch? Monkford has a dark side. He also has a past. The other catch? Emma didn’t leave One Folgate Street alive – she left in a body bag. Will Jane escape the clutches of One Folgate Street before it’s too late? Will she say ‘screw it’ to all those clauses in her contract, and run? She really should.An instant bestseller with a movie in the works, The Girl Before was also recently named ‘Thriller of the Month’ by The Sunday Times.

Although, I have never heard of the author J.P. Delaney this book is going to be the most talked about book in 2017 when it hits the shelves and stores around the world. This story is told from alternate POVs which I've absolutely come to love in books. We are being told a story from \"Before Emma\", a previous occupant in yet a very unconventional but architecural marvel, who once suffered from a home break in and has come to this home for safety. Next we have \"Now Jane\", the current occupant, who was lead her to forget her past and her personal tragedy. Both are trying to escape their past, while seeing their journey parallel to one another and both fall and begin relationship with the owner of this crazy amazing home. Which by the way the home itself could be another fascinating character in the story. Well that's a glimpse of what's to come if you read this book. You'll be guessing until the end.

The idea, he claims, is that people can be changed by this state-of-the art dwelling and minimalist living style. The narration alternates between Emma (THEN) and Jane (NOW). Each has her own personality and both have recently experienced an event that has left them vulnerable and weakened. Now they become obsessed by the house, the architect, and those that lived there before -- especially when it seems that death has visited. The characters have a lot of depth and the chapters are short so the book moves very fast. Manipulation, deception, and suspicion lead to only one end.Ignore the fact that these books of psycho drama featuring women are now always compared to those titles I will not name, but you know what I mean. There is a lot of hype about this novel, and it is definitely one all fans of this genre should read. The author is writing under a pseudonym and you can tell it's not a debut work.Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine for the e-book ARC to review.

I think I would've liked a bit more time on each character before swapping over in paragraphsI also found the minimalist rules hard to swallow. Conditions of being able to rent mean these women have to give up all their possessions and follow a series of rules set out by the creepy architect of the house who may or may not have killed his wife and buried her under the patio. I understand the need for a fresh start but how about a bit of de-cluttering instead??The language is sparse, designed to suit the house and minimalist ideas giving you a quick read. I do actually like the design of the house as I could picture it with everything having it's place but I'm not signing a lease that bars me from cushions to keep the aesthetic.

A pacy read, it alternates between the viewpoints of two women, one before and one after. The plot centres around a house that first Emma and subsequently Jane have signed up to live in, despite a hefty set of unusual rules, and an owner who may not be quite what he seems. It kept me interested and was a quick, easy read, with some good shock moments peppered throughout, and the obligatory 'twist' at the end. Overall, however, it wasn't outstanding. I didn't really care for either of the main characters, or anyone else in the book for that matter, but then in all of the thrillers I have read in this vein, that has been the case. It is a light, entertaining read probably suited to fans of the other big players in this sub-genre (Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train etc. etc.) but aside from one or two well written creepy moments, it won't be one you can't stop thinking about. I do feel it could have been elevated to provide a higher shock factor if Jane had made a different decision towards the end of the book, and indeed this lack of decision is the only element that has stayed with me after finishing reading. I hear it has been picked up for a film version, and it reads like it was written with just that intention.

I'm not sure about the comparisons to Gone Girl, because this book doesn't have time for the intense character development of that book, because it has more characters, one being a very cool, and yet disturbing house.  This book goes back and forth in time, alternating between two women who both rent a cutting edge 'smart house' from a mysterious architect who interviews new residents and gives them a set of rules.  These rules are not just the 'no pets-no-kids' type rules--more like a 'lifestyle' set of rules with questionnaires popping up periodically that cause the 'smart house' to shut down all amenities until the questions are answered.  A bit over-bearing, just like the landlord, a handsome, mysterious award winning architect who believes that our living spaces should change and define us.  Now you get a sense of the weirdness of the house, and it's builder so it's on to two very damaged women who live in the house at different times. One, who's had her previous apartment burglarized, and the other woman who's had a stillborn child's.  The plot moves back and forth between the two women as we learned what really happened. Since this is a thriller, I don't want to give anything away.  Just have fun reading and trying to guess 'who done it'.

Slabs of pale stone, expansive plate glass, soaring ceilings, tile floors, a stairway with no railing.  An app controls lighting, shower pressure and internet access. There already have been three deaths at the site.  Maybe another one soon?Edward Monkford, the owner and architect, rents the austere structure at a bargain price, but there are stipulations.  No clutter of any sort.  Compliance is monitored by sensors and cameras.  An applicant is interviewed by the sleek owner and fills out a long questionnaire, which begins: “Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.”The story is told in alternating chapters by Jane, the new tenant, and Emma, “the girl before.”  They look alike.  Both are recovering from traumas.  Both become involved with Edward.  Jane learns that Emma died in a fall from the unguarded stairs and that Edward’s wife and young son were killed in an accident during construction at the site.  According to Emma’s therapist, Jane is in danger.  From Edward?  Will Jane become the next  girl before?”  We find out at the violent climax.I hesitated to pick up another book with “girl” in the title, having read “Gone Girl,” “The Girl on the Train” and others.

They have to complete a lengthy questionnaire on their values, submit to an interview, and provide three photos.  It is framed as a social experiment.And then every now and then the Housekeeping program sends more questions and until the occupant answers them, certain functions of the house are shut down.The story is cleverly told and for a while the reader can't tell if the  girl before  is Emma or Jane.  I don't usually like alternating chapter voices, but this is well done.As the story unfolds, the reader learns more about Emma and Jane.  Neither has been quite honest.I'm not usually able to guess who  did it  but I did in this case.

Mind you, when I say I like these differences, it's not because I dislike the way things were handled in Butcher's books. I'm saying that I like them because those are the things that make these iron Druid books distinct from the Dresden files. It gives the books their own distinct feel. Normally, I'd probably give this one a 4/5 stars. But given that it's the author's first book AND the fact that I know I was unfairly comparing this book to the Dresden files all the way through...

At any rate, this one took off for me after a little bit and I freaking fell in love. I mean this book has so much stuff in it! All kinds of gods, references to gods, God, the devil. We have Vampire and Werewolf attorneys, goblins, ogres... gah! there is just so much. Anyhoo, so Atticus is a 2100 year old Druid, the last Druid I might add, unless of course the author brings another one into the story later. Atticus poses as 21 and owns a store that has crystals and herbs and what not. AND, he has a talking relationship with his Irish Wolfhound, Oberon. OMG! He's my new book boyfriend, er, druid. This book is both funny, narly and plenty of awesomeness. Sooooooooooooooooooooooo, this evil god dude lt;-- was he a god? Now I can't remember, either way he was a jerk evil demon dude and he blames Atticus for stealing his sword. The sword is named Fragarach the Answerer and it's bad to the bone, it will kill you deader than dead in a second. There is a whole history there but you can read it yourself! Atticus is living in Arizona and has been off the radar from said jerko for years, but apparently gods or demons, minions, whatever can surf the net and find people. Yeah, I know right? And Atticus was stupid enough to put his real info-ish out there. Now he is being hunted. A few things the old jerko send after Atticus to try to get the sword and kill Atticus before he gets there end up having a bad day or night. And it's amazeballs! OMG! Oh and there is the Morrigan who is the death goddess. She's on Atticus side so to speak and stuff. And Atticus has a werewolf (Hal) and a vampire (Leif) as his attorney's. I mean this is just too cool for me to handle people! There are just so many cool things that you just have to read the book. The earth energy that Atticus uses, just all kinds of stuff. Oh and the old widow lady down the street, Mrs. MacDonagh who drinks like crazy, loves Atticus and is okay with him killing stuff and having werewolf friends. Lol! She's a hoot! I'm going to leave this review with some excerpts. Some are of Oberon the dog who has an obsession with Geghis Khan and French Poodles! **EXCERPTS**\n  The bars along the wall of my shop had melted silently apart behind them and morphed into jaws of sharp iron teeth. The giant black maw reached out for them and snapped closed, scissoring through the fairies' flesh as if it were cottage cheese, and then they were inhaled like Jell-O, with time only for a startled, aborted scream. Their weapons clattered to the ground, all glamour gone, and then the iron mouth melted back into its wonted shape as a series of bars, after gracing me with a brief, satisfied grin. I got a message from the iron elemental before it faded away, in the short bursts of emotions and imagery that they use for language: //Druid calls/ Fairies await / Delicious / Gratitude//••••••••••There was no time to negotiate. He nodded once and said, \"They don't look very tough.\"\"They're giants using glamour, so don't trust your eyes. Use your other senses. What does their blood smell like?\" They were almost upon us, but it was a worthwhile question. Leif's eyes widened when he caught the scent of their blood. \"They are strong,\" he said. \"Thanks, Atticus.\" He grinned, his fangs lengthening as he smiled. \" I have not had my breakfast yet.\"\"Look at it like an all-you-can-eat buffet.\" I said, and then there was no more time for talking. Not one to be shy, Leif launched himself in a superhuman leap against the leading Fir Bolg, far above where his head was according to mortal eyes. That's because the giant's neck was actually about three feet higher, and the Fir Bolgs slowed down when they saw their leader taken down by a guy in an English business suit. But slowing down wasn't the same as stopping.••••••••••\"Agreed,\" the vampire said. \"I am full right now anyway. I need to work some of this off.\" He dug a cell phone out of his-or, I should say, my-breast pocket and used a speed-dial number to call someone named Antoine. \"I have dinner for the whole crew at Mitchell Park in Tempe right now. Bring the truck . . . Yes, there is enough for everybody, trust me. See you there.\" Whoa. He had ghouls on speed dial. My lawyer kicks so much ass.••••••••••I rose from my chair and Oberon began to trot in front of me down the hall to the bathroom, his tail wagging again. *Will you tell me about Genghis Khan's whores while I'm in the bath?*Hordes, not whores. He had both, though now that you mention it. *Sounds like he was a busy guy.*You have no idea.••••••••••*Did you get me that movie about Genghis Khan?*It's in the Netflix queue, but that's not the surprise. You don't need to worry, it'll be something good. I just don't want you to feel depressed about going home. *Oh, I won't. But it would be cool to have a stream like this in the backyard. Can you make one?*Umm. . . no.*I figured. Can't blame a hound for trying*Oberon was indeed surprised when we got back home to Tempe. Hal had made the arrangments for me, and Oberon perked up as soon as we were dropped off by the shuttle from the car rental company.*Hey, smells like someone's in my territory,* he said. Nobody could be here without my permission, you know that. *Flidais did it.*That isn't Fidais you smell, believe me. I opened the front door, and Oberon immediately ran to the kitchen window that gazed upon the backyard. He barked joyously when he saw what was waiting for him there. *French poodles! All black and curly with poofy little tails!*And every one of them in heat. *Oh, WOW! Thanks, Atticus! I can't wait to sniff their asses!* He bounded over to the door and pawed at it because the doggie door was closed to prevent poodles from entering. You earned it buddy. Hold on, get down off the door so I can open it for you, and be careful, don't hurt any of them. I opened the door, expecting him to bolt through it and dive into his own personal canine harem, but instead he took one step and stopped, looking up at me with a mournful expression, his ears drooping and a tiny whine escaping his snout. *Only five?*\nFin =)MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:46.985473"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:46.985473"]]

Readers are not looking for intangibles, they are looking for escape! Depth often makes them feel out of their depth so why not create some positive impact. Research your mythology of choice, then surround that central mythology with as many other mythologies and fantasy figures as you possibly can. This tried-and-true formula has guaranteed success. Satisfy everyone! Celtic mythology can only be improved by adding such cultural icons as the Vampire, the Werewolf, Coyote, and Thor! The lucrative and open-ended series of your dreams is only hours away. You can make it happen! As the song goes... \"Drown me in the shallow waters before I get too deep\"!Session 2: Forget Resonance And Create FUNDedicated, career-minded professional and beginning screenwriters, directors, producers, novelists, creative studio executives, video game creators and everyone else should understand that their livelihood depends on knowing what makes a story great and successful. The answer is non-resonant FUN! As we move through a step-by-step journey from the \"inspiration\" to the final draft, we will take an in-depth look at all the essential concepts... story structures and principles, metaphor (the secret language of great stories), the creative unconscious (the source of our creativity) and the Golden Paradigm (the story model that contains the hidden story structures all great stories have in common)... and then quickly throw it all in the trash where it belongs. You are not writing Ulysses, you're writing a high concept idea that can last years! The key is FUN! Session 3: The Ancient Path to EnlightenmentThis is a class that reveals techniques that have been taught from time immemorial to connect one to the primal life energy that enlivens the earth, plants, animals, man, and the universe. And Urban Fantasy series! The universe is alive and conscious. The planets themselves are but the shadow of the great beings, which influence our lives and organize time through their orbits around the sun. This session functions as an introduction to the Ancient Path of Enlightenment, the path that utilizes \"mantra\" to invoke the ancient archetypes that exist in the collective unconscious from time immemorial. It is an experiential path. In this class you will experience the importance of creating your \"spirit animal\": a cute and loveable talking dog named Oberon. This dog will be your guide on your path to making money. Your paths leads back to you. You are the path. You are a money magnet. You will attract money easily and effortlessly. Money will come to you every day in every way. The Universe takes care of your every need. Abundance flows to you every day. Abundance flows to you in every way. You are open to receiving money now.(view spoiler)[i actually rather liked this one. it was often frustratingly stupid and shallow and without resonance and that fucking dog was about as precious amp; cutesy-poo as can be imagined. this is a 2 star read but it was still a lot of fun and the celtic stuff was occasionally interesting. i will probably forget the whole experience within a few weeks. eh, at least it was semi-enjoyable while it lasted.if you are looking for resonant Urban Fantasy, read American Gods (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:46.990887"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:46.990887"]]

I gave it to him, he loved it, and then promptly wanted to talk about what had happened in the story. Aw, fuck.Yeah, I'd forgotten everything, so I had to 'refresh' my memory. Luckily, this was one of those first books in a series that wasn't bogged down by too much set up for the next installment or info-dump world building. In fact, I was kinda shocked at how well it was paced!Bonus: Thanks to my faulty memory chip, this was like reading a brand new story.Anyway, I think my original review still sums up how I feel about this one.Original review 2012It started off a little slow and clunky (my opinion), but after a few chapters things started clicking together. Really well.Atticus is a 2000 plus year old Druid who makes his home in Arizona. Other than running an occult shop (and occasionally selling fake weed to stoners), he has generally tried to lay low to avoid a powerful enemy who has been after him for over a millennium. Because he stole the guy's sword. A bad ass sword. Evidently, the Celtic god of love isn't very lovable. In fact, he's pretty pissed.And that's where the story starts...Atticus reminds me a lot of a hot Harry Dresden. I'm not saying Hearne ripped-off Butcher, though. Hearne's writing style isn't as chaotic as Jim Butcher's, for one thing. The similarity is that both characters are the kind of humorous underdogs that everyone loves to root for.Hounded is a great 1st book in what looks to be a very good urban fantasy series. I have the next one waiting for me right now, and you can bet your ass I'll be reading it as soon as I can save this review...P.SOn a side note, I loved that Thor was described as a huge douche in this book.

Sexy, redheaded Irish hero. Why, because I have a thing for red-headed guys, and I am a proud person of Irish ancestry, so I think Irish people are cool!2. Hero is a druid who can also kick butt like nobody's business. Why, because I love characters who can kick butt, and druids are so mysterious and underutilized in contemporary fantasy.3. The hero communicates with his dog. Why, because I am crazy about animals, I love the human/animal bond, and I thought Oberon was freaking hilarious with his obsessions with sniffing butts, sausage, and French Poodles.4. Celtic Mythology. Why, well that goes back to my love of the Irish and the Celts (and mythology in general). Um, I do have to say that I prefer my Christian deity, because I don't trust those Celtic gods as far as I can throw them (no offense to those who believe in Celtic pantheism).5. The Arizona setting. Why? I hate hot weather, but the desert has a raw beauty that appeals. Hearne does it very well here, and not too many books that I've read were set in Arizona.6. The variety of magical elements and beasties here. Why, because I am a fantasy nerd. Enough said!7. Swords and swordfighting. If you don't know, I can't tell you why this is cool.8. Werewolves. Why? I love werewolves. I just do. And these are Scandinavian werewolves, even cooler!9. Wicked witches. Why, because I like to read books with wicked witches!10.This book was laugh out loud funny. Why? I love to laugh.Bonus: Dang, Atticus has some good lawyers!

Then the treads started up with many authors pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. Walking back to the genres has been (so far) very good with the help of many of my GR friend’s reviews; I’ve had a lot of luck with PNR and Romantic UFs, but haven’t had the true courage to try my hand at a UF until Hounded. Hounded is a book that made me remember why I loved and miss the genre so much! There was never a true dull moment in this book, and it was hard for me to walk away without wanting to read just a few more pages…! And that alone is a mark that I’m soo going to enjoy this book! Atticus O’Sullivan is the last Druid and for the past two thousand years has been hunted by a fae god out to get a powerful sword that Atticus has kept hidden. After so much running Atticus is tried of the BS and has finally decided to make a stand, that will involved all his knowledge and magical abilities, his friends, his vampire and werewolf lawyers and a few helpful and not so helpful visits from some gods. My impression of what Atticus would be liked was thrown out the window soon after reading the first few pages. Being around before even Jesus walked the Earth. I thought he be this stale Druid, whom be all bad moody magical power wielding dude. Oh, he one bad magical power wielding dude, but without the flash and sparkle you see now of days with other books and characters. Atticus earth magic makes him more well- earthy and that alone gives you a clue of what Atticus is about. A somewhat laid back type of guy, whom has a great sense of humor, but observant with years and years and years of knowledge and has seen things we can only read in the history books. Atticus has a great respect for everyone if you respect him in return, and a pretty normal guy when it comes to attraction when it comes to the ladies. By all accounts Atticus would be like any of one of us when walking down the street, and that gave him his great charm and made me fall hard for him. He wasn’t flashy, he didn’t just run into danger, and he took care of his close friend and hound Oberon. He won all points for me on the I-want-to-marry-you scale. There were also moments of deep feelings and emotions when Atticus remembers his past, but Atticus is more of a present man, and truly cherished those around him in the now as he did to those he’s lost. From the get go you know the author did his homework, but instead of giving you an overdose helping of history, the author worked it very nicely into the story, making it easy to follow whose who. While the beginning was a tad slow for me, with a lot of tell and no show, it wasn’t without it’s moments of great humor and getting to know about the world.  The world was very open with a lot of gods and goddess running around, walking among humans. Along with werewolves, vampires. The author never lets you get confused, but gives you tidbits to help you along. There’s pure humor with a vampire and a werewolf being lawyers and being paid $350 an hour! And not to forgot our human characters of a very “normal” old widow who loves her whiskey and sneaks a little into church to mellow out ;D Hounded won another brownie point with me with the lack of smut. “What!? Rane have you lost your mind, no smut!?” Yup, that’s right. No smut. Not that I don’t love me some smut. But UF authors tend to just use them as a filler, the only part was more of a booty call off screen, which I was very happy and content with. As with any book I like to read about the hero and his heroine or the woman he’ll end up with then just some random chick. Plus, again I didn’t really think he even “liked” the goddess - and that alone was a turn off for me. So it being off screen was fine and was a show that Atticus had a healthy and active sex life period. No more information need and that was alright by me! It gave the reader time to fours more on the ongoing story.  The magical aspect of the story truly fascinated me, with much of it center around the Irish gods and goddess. It wasn’t all history; much of the humor and trying to blend in, Atticus was very much up to date even more so then some others (even him being way older) Atticus did have some completion in the favorite character scale, the runner was his beloved Irish wolfhound Oberon. While he could commutate with Atticus, he was still very much a dog, with a deep love of anything meat and French poodles. He was very smart and understood much of what was going around him. Oberon was the sort of anchor that Atticus needed to stop and smell the roses once in awhile, and that’s was a true friend is all about.  The battles scenes had me reading quickly, I loved the use of Atticus magic abilities and wondering what was in store next for Atticus. And were there some great surprises that like Atticus I never saw coming.  Throughout the review I mention the humor, and this book had some golden moments of humor that had me rolling in the chair. “Drives in the back of an ambulance are simultaneously boring and stressful. I needed a relief from both. Paramedic Man wasn’t about to talk to me anymore, so I decided to mess with him a bit. Am I above immature trickery? No. It keeps me young.  Using a bit of power recently banked in my bear charm, I bound a few of the natural threads in the elastic band of his underwear to the fine hairs in the center of his back about five inches up. The result was an instant wedgie. Those have been funny for two thousand years, but they’re even more hilarious when your victim is sanctimoniously trying to behave like he knows more then you. I shouldn’t have done it, though, because his reaction- a girlish squeal followed by a high octave “Ahhh! What the fuck!?!?” and an abrupt attempt to stand up, cracks his head on the ceiling. …” Two great goodies of short stories with everyday happenings with Atticus and Oberon topped off my enjoyment of this book and had me marking down on my calendar the next book in the series.  Hounded brought back the joy I felt when reading a great UF keeper of a book, and with it a new rising star of an author to be on the look-out for."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:46.999418"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:46.999418"]]

For the first third or so of the book I wasn't certain how I felt about it, but this was largely due to my hesitancy to jump to conclusions. Well the potential middle of the road rating quickly deteriorated to a well-deserved one star. Needless to say I will not be continuing in the series unless I am at a level of boredom I have not yet experienced.Let's start with Atticus. Atticus is supposed to be a Druid who is 2,100 years old. However, he acts like an idiotic teenager who thinks he knows it all. Atticus is far too immature to be believed as anyone who is more than a few decades old rather than 21 centuries old. Shouldn't one who has lived this long be a little more rough around the edges, a bit more wise? He makes ridiculous comments (jokes some might say if they were actually funny), is obnoxious to gods despite their ability kill him (oh please get rid of him Morrigan!), says whoa! and gadzooks (oh yes, very mature) and cannot contain his horniness despite literally being ancient. Atticus' inner dialogue is also quite clearly modern-day American and nothing like what you would expect someone who has lived so long to be. Shouldn't he be an amalgamation of the history he has lived??One of the worst scenes in the book by far? When Atticus gives a paramedic a WEDGIE while he is trying to help him with a gunshot wound. WHAT THE F%amp;K is that?!?!?! A freakin wedgie???? Oh yes, I think 2,100 years is enough for Atticus. He also sleeps with this or that goddess because apparently he is irresistible. Yes, the red curly hair and long goatee is just freakin unbearably irresistible (not). When all is said and done, Atticus is quite frankly who Kevin Hearne dreams he could be. Male fantasy fulfillment is splashed across every page of this book.This book is a classic example of telling not showing. Clearly the author was also trying too hard and it came through the writing. He tried hard to be funny but it just simply failed most of the time. The dialogue was stilted and the dull info-dumps were nearly unbearable. The gods in the book were unimpressive as they were never fleshed out. I was largely attracted to the book due to the Celtic mythology aspect but Hearne failed in this department as well.And then there is Oberon. Oberon does not strike me as a dog at all, just some jackass' idea of what a dog would sound like if you could communicate with him/her. I absolutely hated the storyline with Oberon wanting French poodles and then Atticus buying(?) poodles for Oberon to have his way with. Oh great, dog rape, what a grand way to end the male fantasy book!P.S. Atticus gives Oberon (a DOG) both coffee and tea in this book, both of which are TOXIC to dogs. Caffeinated drinks such as coffee and tea have a similar impact on a dog's system that chocolate does (which hopefully people know is toxic as well). I hate to think of the number of idiots who gave their dog coffee or tea after reading this book, or at least thought it was ok! So not only a poor book but it sets a terrible example as well (and that isn't even counting the wedgies....ugh)."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.002963"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.002963"]]

But what does that have to do with a coven of witches? And which side are Flidais and the other gods on? Can Atticus escape with his skin, even with a pack of werewolves and a vampire lawyer on his side?I had my eye open for a new urban fantasy series to try once the Dresden Files began tasting like ashes in my mouth. When the price on the ebook version of this dropped to 99 cents, my choice was made. It turned out to be a pretty good one.Atticus O'Sullivan is a 2000 year old Druid that looks like a tattooed 21 year old. Once I accepted that was the reason he sounded like a modern man, I had a lot of fun reading this.Hounded reads like the Dresden Files with a dash of American Gods thrown in. I found Atticus to be a much more likeable lead than Harry Dresden, primarily because he has personality traits above and beyond being a smart ass. Oberon, his Irish wolfhound, further sealed the deal. I liked the way Hearne depicted Atticus' magic and his Druidic abilities set him apart from a lot of other urban fantasy characters.The supporting cast was equally interesting. The vampire and werewolf lawyer combo was a pretty novel idea and I liked that he didn't overuse them. I also liked Atticus' dealings with the Celtic pantheon and how careful he was when dealing with them and the witches.The Arizona setting was a nice change of pace. The plot wasn't all that revolutionary but I thought it was well done for what it was. When dealing with the gods, a certain amount of treachery is expected and Hearne delivered the goods. It was a fun story.I'm not going to pretend it didn't have some things that irked me. Things were wrapped up a little too nicely and even though I was able to push it aside, I didn't like that Atticus talked so much like a 21st century man. I also question the wisdom of running a store that happens to sell occult books. It's not on par with Tony Stark saying Iron Man is his bodyguard or Peter Parker mysteriously getting the best pictures of Spider-Man but it's in the ballpark.Minor gripes aside, this was a really fun read and well-worth the ninety-nine cents I spent on it. I'll be looking to pick up the rest, hopefully for an affordable price. Four out of five stars.

[["isbn", "9533378"], ["title", "Hounded (The Iron Druid Chronicles, #1)"], ["author", "Kevin Hearne"], ["date", "May 03, 2011"], ["review_text", "I’m kind of torn on this one. On the one hand, it was fast paced, exciting, fun, and humorous. On the other hand, it’s a little muddled, has a couple of plot holes, and is occasionally silly to the point of being cheesy. I enjoyed it, but I honestly don’t know whether I would recommend it to someone else. So here is what I liked and what I didn’t - you decide.Hounded has an interesting premise - a 2,100 year old Druid, along with the Celtic god of death, a magic sword, a pack of werewolves, and a witch, face down the villainous Celtic god of love. Sounds fun, right? It is certainly is a fun read, with enough action to move the plot along at a fast clip. My first problem, though, was with the mythology. It’s cool that Atticus is a Druid and gets to use his awesome Druid powers to fight bad guys, and I also like how random Celtic gods keep showing up to mess with him. But this story doesn’t just embrace Irish mythology - it tries to encompass every mythology. That’s right, every god and monster known to man is real, including Jesus, the Virgin Mary, Allah, Thor, vampires, ghouls, and so on. While this premise provides the potential for all kinds of craziness and trouble to ensue, it also muddies the waters a bit too much in my opinion. It feels like the author is trying to do everything and the story could easily get out hand with all these supernatural figures running around. Perhaps it would have been cleaner and more plausible if it had just focused on Celtic mythology and left the rest alone.Despite the muddled world building, the plot was pretty good. The identity of the villain is no secret, but the loyalties of the various gods and witches are never certain. Almost everyone has ulterior motives, and it’s not easy to figure out who’s trustworthy and who’s not. That being said, there were a couple of tiny plot holes that really bugged me. You’ll recognize them when you find yourself thinking, “That... doesn’t make sense.”The characters are likable, if not realistic. Atticus acts like he’s fifteen at times, but he’s a hero you can root for. My favorite character by far is Atticus’ Irish wolfhound, Oberon. He’s funny and adorable, and he’s largely responsible for why I like Atticus. The Celtic gods are also intriguing, and several of them have the hots for Atticus. It’s not sexy so much as it’s silly and amusing, but it doesn’t reach the level of cheesy that is the character Mrs. MacDonagh, the elderly, Irish widow that lives in Atticus’ neighborhood. I think she’s supposed to provide comic relief, but her antics and attitudes border on the ridiculous. No one would act the way she does, making her character little more than a cartoon. Some of the other supporting characters are thin as well, but that’s to be expected in a first installment when the cast is just starting to be introduced.Regardless of its deficiencies, Hounded gets major points for making me laugh out loud. Atticus has some pretty cheesy one-liners, but other parts are truly hilarious. For example, I was cracking up as I read the paragraph where Atticus explains how he is able to cry on cue. (I won’t spoil it.) Oberon’s obsession with Genghis Khan and French poodles also gave me some genuine laughs.Overall, Hounded is funny and entertaining, an enjoyable read despite the problems I have with the overambitious mythology, the plot holes, and the cheesy characters. It’s a decent debut with plenty of room for improvement as the series progresses. I might pick up the next book, Hexed, when I feel in the mood for some light reading and a few laughs.(Note: This is a review of the advance reader’s edition of Hounded. Changes may have been made before it went to press.)"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.026176"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.026176"]]

A very intelligent dog who happens to be loyal and helpful in a pinch, but would rather be eating sausages and banging french poodles. Oh yeah, and this Atticus guy carries a big sword.

He's an ancient druid and is the kind of sexy in a way you'd find from meeting one of those casual cool guys who knows he's all that, but doesn't seem to really care or pay attention to it.This book is an action filled, gender-neutral Urban Fantasy that will appeal to the people who are tired of fluffy paranormals.

His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old--when in actuality, he’s twenty-one centuries old.

Today's prompt, the 28th, is to discuss your favorite animal in fiction. Who else could it be but Oberon the Wolfhound?Let me start with this:There are many perks to living for twenty-one centuries, and foremost among them is bearing witness to the rare birth of genius. It invariably goes like this: Someone shrugs off the weight of his cultural traditions, ignores the baleful stares of authority, and does something his countrymen think to be completely batshit insane. Of those, Galileo was my personal favorite. Van Gogh comes in second, but he really was batshit insane.Now, I ask you. Can a normally-constructed reader of any but the grimmest and least amusant of books fail to see the humor in that? I am on record as being no fan of phauntaisee nawvelles with their styoopid Misspelynnges and Random capitaLizations to indicate magjickq is in Use. So I approach each recommended genre book with, well, trepidation. (I'm stretching for polite words that mean \"strenuous desire to insult author, publisher, and recommender.\") So these couple of ladies here on LT tag-teamed me, beat my head into the mat, kicked my nose through the back of my head, and started breaking bones I can't operate without until I got this book and read it.When you're in the middle of a killing field and the fucking Chooser of the Slain tells you to do something, you do it.Yeah. That.The more observant of my readers will have noted the four-star rating above. This was not in the least a foregone conclusion, even with the chuckles and the muffled hoots the book provided. I am not any kind of a fan of straight-people sex, having memories of same that range from boredom on the high end all the way down to horror. Three stars is the most I'll give anything with more than a token window-dressing of girl-sex. Yes, I know lots of people do it, but it's icky and I don't want to hear about it. That fourth star?Monty Python is like catnip for nerds. Once you get them started quoting it, they are constitutionally incapable of feeling depressed.Okay, Hearne. I'm gaffed through the gills. Yes, my mouth still fills with nausea-water at the sex, but you've hit The Nerve. Wry and funny? Yes please. Handsome, tattooed, and Irish? TRIFECTA! Twenty-one hundred years old and talks like a lamebrained kid? Well...I have been around long enough to discount most superstitions for what they are: I was around when many of them began to take root, after all. But one superstition to which I happen to subscribe is that bad juju comes in threes. The saying in my time was, \"Storm clouds are thrice cursed,\" but I can't talk like that and expect people to believe I'm a twenty-one year-old American. I have to say things like, \"Shit happens, man.”And now we're on a different plane of storytelling. In the voice of the character, the author explains why anachronism is alive and well, and does so with a level of character development that shows something I don't get very often in any book: Respect for the reader. \"I'm telling you a story about an immortal magical being who lives in the armpit of creation, USA, voluntarily, and needs to blend in as much as possible. Here is how it's done, why it's done, and what you can expect from the character.\"Not only is the fourth star secured to the sleeve with tiny, tough stitches, but the sale is made for book two and book three. Of seven (I think), mind you, but still that's more than I'd even *dream* of doing absent this surprising development.As Atticus himself said, “Winning ugly is still winning.” \n  This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.044603"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.044603"]]

It has a childishly simple plot, which still manages to get buried under page after page of the sort of clumsy exposition and background information that can only be shovelled on by an author who clearly believes the 'show, don't tell' adage applies to other people. It has a supporting cast of characters who, when they're not cheap caricatures lifted directly from Urban Fantasy for Dummies are so poorly fleshed out as to be virtually non-existent. And it has a narrator/protagonist who is supposedly two thousand years old and Irish, yet carries on an internal monologue that is entirely twenty-first century American at all times, complete with pop-culture references that never stray to older than a decade. Although I suppose this could be something of a blessing, as if the central character had been in a similar vein to the elderly Irish neighbour who's conversation seems entirely limited to 'Top of the morning!', 'You'll never get me Lucky Charms!' and 'Kill the English', I'd probably have burned the whole book in disgust.You could probably get away with those problems though. Whilst being chronologically and ethnically confused, the protagonist Atticus O'Sullivan has a certain charm about him, and is occasionally quite amusing. What kills the book is that he's also the worst kind of adolescent wish fulfilment super-powered stupidity. As mentioned, he's two thousand years old. And the last of the druids. And has ridiculously over-done magic powers. And he's a great swordsmen. And has a magic sword that can cut through anything. And is friends with a vampire and some werewolves. And the goddess of death. Oh, and he has a talking dog. Effectively he has the super-power of being able to kill drama. It's probably not a good idea to have your protagonist fighting gods in the first novel of a series anyway, but if you must at least have them rely on luck, or cunning, or their opponent's over confidence and arrogance, or at least a lot of help. Don't whatever you do just have them go toe to toe and win through being better at everything. In a perverse way, it's actually sort of impressive that at one point our hero gets shot in the chest, and Hearne is still unable to generate even the slightest sense of peril. I'm guessing the author thinks that the existence of kryptonite spoils Superman.But having said all that, somehow it still manages to be sort of fun. Fun like reading bad Harry Potter fan fiction, where for some reason Harry is brought up by ninjas, given bionic limbs and defeats Voldemort in a light sabre duel on the bridge of an exploding airship that's crashing into an erupting volcano. Fun that makes you feel kind of dirty and ashamed, and feeling you've somehow betrayed your intellect and critical faculties by getting caught up in it all. But still fun. It's a book that your inner twelve-year old will enjoy every minute of. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing, once in a while.Just don't tell anyone else you liked it. Or publicly review it on a major website.Oh bugger...

The info-dump is off-putting; too much, too fast. Dialogue-overload. Not enough description.Atticus claims to be 2,100 or just 21 to humans. He lies to everyone but the humans. He ain't two thousand years old. There's no way. He brags about the famous historical events he's witnessed, the powerful and dangerous gods he knows, and thinks his physical prowess is that of a ninja. He sounds like an immature boy. Show me you've lived longer than most, don't just tell me. He also feels too modern and \"down with the kids\". These gods care enough to warn Atticus of an impending threat on his life but he doesn't take them seriously. Even after he is attacked. I don't understand why they care if he never listens to them.One of said gods has promised not to let Atticus die. So if he's in terrible agony from multiple wounds, he won't die. That's awful. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy, and this woman is supposed to be an ally. Some ally. No thanks. I wasn't impressed with the gods we met in the beginning. Not much intelligence or wisdom to be found in them. They were only concerned with petty grievances and vengeance. The norm for gods generally, though some semblance of substance or the ability to champion a worthwhile cause would've been nice, anything to show some depth of character to engender interest from me as the reader.I hear Oberon is a hoot and an adorable sidekick.

Definite fun. Atticus is the first praciticing druid I've read about in a long while, and it's nice to have a new take on magic in the urban fantasy line. In fact, all sorts of immortals and deities seem to be present, particularly from Celtic and Norse mythologies. They actually behave a lot like the stereotypes of gods from mythology (at least in the Greek myths I read), which is to say, manipulative, egotistical and randy. Hearne does a nice job of balancing their scary powers with approachability. Just like the Greek gods--sometimes you could wheedle a favor out of them if you had the right gift. Vampires, werewolves and witches also play a role in the action.Characters are very likeable, although at first Atticus really seems a lot like a moderately interesting 25 year old rather than a 2100 year old druid. That's one of my only complaints about the series to date; I just don't have the feel of great age behind him, only power. Sure, his running a store in the middle of campus might keep him in contact with current culture, but I expect him to be a little more ponderous and thoughtful. Oberon the wolfhound kept me laughing, especially the running joke about \"Oberon Khan.\" I like their banter, and Atticus' consideration for their relationship.Hearne's attempt to fully integrate the 'real world' of police, persistent detectives and nosy neighbors is interesting too--so many urban fantasy books have the cops either on the \"clueless\" or \"colluding\" list, that it's another interesting take to seem them behaving normally.I like the small touches, like the bar with the best fish and chips, and the lawyerly behavior of both vampire and werewolves. I do think the big battle was over too quickly for it to feel satisfying for the build-up; it was the only moment that pacing felt truly disruptive. Otherwise, hugely enjoyable and I'll definitely keep reading the series.Cross-posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.056527"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.056527"]]

Bad guy wants to defeat hero and take possession of powerful item that hero possesses. Hero has a lot of power, he can use it almost indefinitely and he is funny.

I got into a urban fantasy groove, so to speak. It is very hard not to fall in love with Atticus and Oberon. They have a sarcastic, pop culture-y, dry sense of humor that is very enjoyable to read. I loved their banter. And as the action picked up, I was pressing my nose to the pages (metaphorically!) to get further into the scenes. I began really really loving it.

I have to admit that my general reaction to Urban Fantasy is somewhat less than warm, but for some odd reason I can't quite figure out, I still get sucked right in and I enjoy some of them immensely. I started with Laurell K Hamilton, and even stayed with it through the myriad sexcapades. Then I was heavily surprised and overjoyed with Kim Harrison (and still am). Then, missing my guilty UF pleasures, I decided to go for Jim Butcher and was also very deeply pleased by it all. I've read a few others and haven't been that impressed. This being said, I'm still willing to try out others from the genre, just in case.I cannot say this novel is going to be ranking at the best that those other series can produce, at least until I've seen a progressive arc in story and character development. What I can talk about is the premise and possibilities. We're starting with a strong character from the get go. Think about a 4th through 8th book leveled-up main character starting out in book one instead. Allow him no serious hang-ups (read as plot) sex, money, or drugs. He's a little over two KA old and the last of the ancient druids and he's often an unwilling pawn to Irish gods. So far, so good. Now he's developing dramatic tension. His best friend is his dog, but most of the book (besides some killer action sequences) is going to be simple introduction of characters that will almost certainly be introduced in later books. This, in itself, is a good thing because I've gotten the first five. Without introducing spoilers, I will say that we've got a satisfactory plot, albeit straight as an arrow.Not too bad for a first in a series. I think most people read UF to be gratified by sexy characters, big action, big magic, and most importantly, easy reads. If so, this is definitely their kind of book. I like the initial premise, too, but then again, I like books with great ideas. Mind you, there's not a ton of them here, yet, but there are a few and I like what I see. Never judge a UF by only one book, regardless. Off I go to read the second!Edit 10/21/15And now I've read a ton more UF titles, but this series still ranks up there as a must read every time a new book comes out.

I barely finished the first chapter when I went online and quickly ordered the next 2 books in the series.There is so much to like about Kevin Hearne’s book Hounded, book 1 of the Iron Druid Chronicles. Take a look at the cover. Nice. Read the blurb on the back cover. Amusing. Hounded is the story of Atticus O’Sullivan, a 2100 year old Druid living as a 21 year old in Arizona. Atticus is in possession of a magical sword Fragarach, The Answer. A whole slew of characters want the sword; the very imposing and scary Aenghus Og at the head of the line.The narrative voice is wonderful. Told from Atticus’ point of view, the main character is very likeable and witty. Atticus has some distinct observations of modern society and a great sense of humor. Most of the books I’ve encountered in the Urban Fantasy genre so far have been written by women and have a woman’s point of view that this book was a refreshing change. The lore is well researched and detailed. The magic and spells feel authentic. Each supernatural creature (and there are many) seems to come alive. I liked how the author melded the mythologies and magic of the fae and druid together and juxtaposes them with current cultural references.For dog lovers, there’s Oberon, the talking Irish wolfhound. Oberon is a loyal companion with a thing for French poodles. Oberon has a almost a child-like view of the world and is totally lovable. Who can dislike a talking dog that quotes Cartman from Southpark?Eccentric characters abound in this book. Atticus’ neighbor, the widow is a hoot! She has no problem keeping bodies buried in her backyard. Atticus entertains powerful goddesses and sleeps with them too. His lawyers are a vampire and a werewolf. What a great start to a series. I can’t wait to read the next book Hexed!

Like any of the god-like set, he must be careful not to offend, even while having a smile at their obtuseness.Unlike so many urban fantasies, which somehow assume that mortals will only be involved by accident, Hearne takes the time to have Atticus interact with the humans around him—the widow whose grass he mows, the nosy neighbor who causes trouble for him, the police force that he must dodge around somehow.

I want to be able to talk to my dogs so much!! ...well, on second thought, maybe not... they would just nag me night and day for food.\n  and if my dog talked baby-talk I might have to shoot myself in the head to make it stop...So, Atticus is a 2,100 year old Druid living in Arizona, running a new age tea shop. He has an ancient magical sword that some jackass god wants, and has been hunting him down to kill him for, for the last 1,000 of those years. But, Atticus has been smart and wiley so far, and has a few allies in the fae realm. There are many fun interactions with goddesses, fae, and other magical creatures along with a few minor battles before we get to the big final battle. The side characters are awesome!The widow MacDonagh is Atticus's neighbor who is very Irish and enjoys her whiskey, but hates the British. When Atticus kills someone and needs to bury the body, all he needs to tell her is that he is British, and voila, she's as helpful as can be.\n  \"He's British?\"\"Aye.\"\"Ah, well then ye can bury the bastard in me backyard, and God damn the queen and all her hellish minions.\"\nThis cracked me up because my husband is English and there is definitely no love lost between him and the Irish. My kids were cracking Irish jokes since they could talk, much to the amusement of my family.The widow brings lots of color to the already colorful story. When Atticus is going out to battle the asshat who wants to kill him and is saying goodbye to her:\n  \"\"I'm going to fight with a god, some demons, and a coven of witches who all want to kill me...\"\"Off y'go, then. Kill every last one o'the bastards and call me in the mornin'.\"\nThe goddesses and fae are also extremely entertaining. They have such a disturbing lack of humanity and absolutely no regard for human life. When Atticus finds the goddess Flidais making a smoothie in his kitchen, she explains that her love for the modern drink came from a man that she hunted down and killed after he hit the smoothie shop.\n  \"So, after I killed him and stowed his body..., I sampled his smoothie concoction in the parking lot and found it to be quite delicious.\"\nEverything about this book was fun. Atticus is funny and entertaining. The story moves at a good pace with plenty of action. And, the side characters are great.There is only one negative about this book, in my opinion. He dares to blaspheme the mighty name of Thor!!!\n  The local college kids would describe Thor as a \"major asshat\" if they ever had the misfortune to meet him.\nEverybody hates Thor in this book. Atticus's vampire lawyer (yeah, a blood sucking lawyer with no soul. It's a stretch to imagine, right?)\n  His fangs pop out if you just say \"Thor\" aloud, and he hunts carpenters simply because they use hammers.\n\n  How dare you sir!!?!!Thor shall ever be the ultimate specimen of male beauty and perfection that all mankind should weep and bow before.\n  that's right, bow down before his manly beauty!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.153385"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.153385"]]

I tried to tell myself it was too early to be so in love. Perhaps I am at fault in this relationship too. The first quarter of the book was amazing!! The world building was fantastic!! The bond I started developing with the main character and his dog, Oberon, was just what I've been looking for. You see, I recently caught up with all the books in the epic Kate Daniels series. I walked into this one feeling the need for another long term commitment. I wanted to find myself hooked on another series. Alas, this wasn't what I was looking for. The middle section of the book found me banging my head into the wall. I was bored. I didn't care. The humor had no affect on me. The only thing that kept me going was Oberon...and my serious OCD to finish things as long as I'm not despising the story, which I wasn't. I was interested just enough that I needed to find out what happened. The last section of the book found some action again. Unfortunately, it was too late to really have me addicted to it. I did have some other minor issues with the story. I initially gave this three stars. When I sat down to write this review, I couldn't justify the three anymore.

I felt that this was an extremely well written story full of snarky lines that I love so much. The relationship between Atticus and Oberon (his wolfhound) was borderline adorable. They were more on a friend level than owner/pet; considering that they were able to speak to each other with their minds probably had something to do with it.

So, many of the kids out there probably loved it and I might have too at the age of 15, but at the age of 30 it was wholly unenjoyable, and ranks high on my worthless drivel list.

I know I know, I'm late to the show on this one. But what can I say - there are only so many hours of the day and only one of me. Thankfully I'm utilizing even more of my time lately by delving more and more into audio books. I had heard this one had some excellent narration and I won't totally disagree. I did really enjoy the narrator Luke Daniels interpretation of all of the voices, except that of Atticus himself (forgive me any name typos as I didn't see the spelling). I think he make Atticus sound a bit cheesey/campy and that isn't how I picture him sounding or acting. Nuance of voice can do a lot to change a character. I am hoping that his narration of Atticus changes and improves over the course of the series (which I think it will because I snuck a sneak listen sample to the latest book Shattered when I was sent a copy for review before I had even started Hounded and that was what prompted me to start from the beginning instead.)Onto the story! Atticus is a druid, one of the only ones left in the world and he is hundreds of years old. He's discovered a concoction for staying young and is putting it to good use. He's not living high on the hog like I would expect a centuries old immortal to be living, instead he owns a modest little bookstore slash tea shop in Arizona. He happens to be in Arizona hiding out from the Celtic god of Love, Angus Og who claims he stole a very powerful sword during a battle a long time ago. He's been sending his lackies after him hunting him all these years to get the sword back.The story opens up with a group of such lackies having found Atticus in front of his shop. Of course Atticus quickly dispatches all (jeez I can't remember how many of them there were now - 3 to 5 of them) with a big old can of whoop ass and that pretty much sets the tone for how much klout Atticus manages against his foes. He not only has the power of regeneration but he can shapeshift into various animal forms, talk to animals and I'm sure a handful of other things I can't recall right now. Where most urban fantasies I read start out with their protagonist being a bit of an underdog and lightweight at first Kevin Hearne rolls Atticus at us with full strength and know how. I'm not exactly sure how much I'll like that because if you're already one of the biggest kids in the playground who could ever really possibly kick your ass? I'm sure that will make for some very interesting bad guys that Atticus will come up against in future novels.I do have a few gripes regarding dialogue in relation to Atticus. I don't know if this was the audio that made some of this dialogue sound clunky or immature/cheesy or if it would have read the same way to me if I were reading the text versus listening to it. It left me with a bit of a disconnect between how old Atticus is really supposed to be and how young and immature he sounded at times. I know that we still want to be able to relate to him as a young early twenties guy to keep the fresh aged feel but I can tell his personality is going to require some getting used to on my part before I fully warm up to him. Now Oberon his dog I absolutely love. But then I always adore animal sidekicks.The plot of this series opener focuses on Angus Og finally finding Atticus and attempting to get the sword back. Various other celtic god players come into the mix and leave Atticus not knowing who he can really trust. There is also a coven of witches, a pack of werewolves and a vampire that get involved in the story rounded this out as a nicely fleshed out urban fantasy. I will definitely be continuing and plan to do so with the audios because it was an extremely quick and enjoyable listen and the narrator's Atticus voice is slowly growing on me.Overall Story: 3.5Audio rating: 3"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.165780"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.165780"]]

Both are humorous and full of pop culture references. Harry Dresden has a talking skull named Bob, Atticus O'Sullivan has an Irish wolfhound he talks to named Oberon. They both keep paranormal company like werewolves, witches and vampires. And always, there's some bad guy trying to kill them, and action ensues. It's inevitable that comparisons will be drawn between these two series. Atticus, however, is a 2,100 year old druid, and despite taking place in modern day Tempe, Arizona, \"Hounded\" is steeped in Celtic mythology and culture. I had a lot of fun reading this book. I would say it is better than the average debut novel, but it is not without its problems. At times, Atticus can be a bit too smug for my taste, and some of the dialogue and references feel forced. It's almost like the author is overcompensating in trying to make the readers buy that the protagonist is 2,100 years old successfully disguising himself by sounding like a 21-year-old college frat boy.I am also curious as to how this series will progress. Atticus comes off as a Mary Sue sometimes -- he's got \"faults\" but not real faults, and also because he's just so damn powerful. One thing I'm really liking about the Dresden Files series so far is the character growth we see in Harry with each subsequent novel. He is a flawed protagonist with limits to his power, and he is often surrounded by foes more dangerous and more skilled than he is. We get to see Harry grow as a character, as well as his skill and power increase as the series progresses.On the other hand, I don't know if we'll see a lot of that in the Iron Druid Chronicles. Atticus already seems to have a magical solution for every problem, or friends that do. There were plot gaps and situations that lacked resolution, conveniently explained away by the many \"I'll-just-wave-my-magic-wand\" or \"It'll-be-taken-care-of-later\" moments.I'm interested in seeing how things will turn out though. Like I said, it was a fun read, and it's always refreshing to read a new urban fantasy novel that doesn't suck. I will definitely be picking up the second book as well as the third.

Hounded was an entertaining enough read but that’s about it.The story has a lot of potential and it could have been a fantastic read but ultimately it all felt a bit meh. The only reasons why I didn’t give this book a 2-star rating? Humour and mythology. The dialogues between Atticus and his dog Oberon are pretty much hilarious most of the time. Well, Atticus has little to do with it and the dog completely steals the show here. He actually makes the story and I’m not sure I would have finished the book . Come to think of it, I liked a lot of characters in this book (the Morrigan, Flidays, Granuaile, Laksha, Hal…) but Atticus, the main character, left me unimpressed. For a druid who is supposed to be 2,000 years old he was disappointingly bland and frankly, quite uninteresting. I couldn’t bring myself to believe, not even for a second, that he was that old. It certainly doesn’t help that he stopped aging at the ripe age of 21...As for the plot itself, it’s basically about lots of bad guys going after the good guy because he has an artefact they want. That’s about it. The only thing that made the story interesting to me was the use of mythology and the various gods amp; creatures that kept popping up throughout the book. There isn’t that much action and I had to resist the urge to skip pages quite a few times.All in all, a light read that could have been a great one, had its potential been fully exploited.

The dedication:\n  \"Look Mom, I made this! Can we put it on the fridge?\"\n Because I'm almost 30 and my mom still makes a huge deal whenever I do something. (And by huge deal I mean probably putting in on the fridge)2. The complete reference of how to pronounce every non-English word in the book, preluded by this: \n  \"Let it be known from the beginning that readers are free to pronounce the names in this book however they see fit\"\n So yes, before starting I was already liking this quite a lot.Now, let's talk about the actual content. Atticus is supposed to be 2100 years old, but he looks (and acts) 21. The main problem is that he's a little bit too awesome: he's young, fit, funny, rich,... *insert here all kind of amazing attributes* Let's face it, the guy is too good to be true. Also, he doesn't sound very wise. Then again, how exactly is a 2100 year old person supposed to sound like?So yes, Atticus is a bit of a Gary Sue. I'm okay with it, but I see how it would grate on other people's nerves.Then we have my favorite part of the book: Oberon, Atticus' wolf hound. \n  After my bathtime story, he wanted to be the Genghis Khan of dogs. He wanted a harem full of French poodles ... Oberon had, in the past, wanted to be Vlad the Impaler, Joan of Arc, Bertrand Russell and any other historical figure I had recently told him about\nThe idea of having a dog sidekick who can telepathically talk with its owner is awesome, but the fact that Oberon spends most of his time watching TV and movies and as such goes around quoting South Park? I have no words for this except: CAN I PLEASE HAVE ONE?! Overall the book was a fun read, the plot is fast paced and has an interesting cast of character and interactions from different pantheons. Is is the best book ever? Nope. Would I recommend it? YES!

For a couple thousand years he’s been hiding from Aenghus Óg, the god who used to own the famous sword Fragarach until Atticus relieved him of it on an ancient battlefield. Now Aenghus has some plans to advance himself among the Tuatha Dé Danann and he wants his sword back.Atticus is now a 21-year-old (it seems) bookshop owner in Tempe, Arizona, near Arizona State University. He sells occult paraphernalia and brews special herbal teas (such as Mobili-Tea and Humili-Tea) for his customers. He’s got a nosey neighbor across the street and a nice Irish widow a few houses down (well, she’s nice as long as you’re not English!). He also has a blood-sucking lawyer. Literally. That’s because the Tempe area attracts lots of paranormals. Some of them are helpful to Atticus, but others are definitely not.I don’t read a lot of paranormal urban fantasy, just because so much of it features snarky women with chips on their shoulders and the sarcastic humor usually doesn’t appeal to me. I’ve found that I’m more likely to enjoy paranormal works which have male leads, so that’s why I gave Hounded a try.Atticus O’Sullivan is an excellent male lead — he’s strong but sensitive. He mows the widow’s lawn and cares for his employees, but he kicks ass when he needs to. Kevin Hearne nearly crosses the border into too-good-to-be-true, but he just manages not to step over that line. Hearne’s other characters are terrific, too. I laughed at the vampire lawyer who drives a hot sports car and wears expensive suits, but can’t manage to update his language. I also appreciated that Hearne shows us that as much as we like to say we hate lawyers, they can be really useful sometimes!My favorite character, though, was Atticus’s dog Oberon who can mind-speak with Atticus. Oberon is the comedic sidekick, providing most of the humor. Only Atticus can hear him, so his comments are often inserted amongst dialogue that Atticus is having with other characters, and this is very funny. Since Oberon watches lots of movies, many of his interruptions are quotes from movies or reminders to Atticus of how what’s happening now is similar to a movie scene. This is especially endearing to SF fans because Oberon loves Star Wars and Star Trek. Oberon always seems to have a current obsession, too. In Hounded, he wants to be Genghis Khan and keeps questioning Atticus about Genghis Khan’s habits, such as did he take his coffee black? (Fortunately, Oberon’s Liberace phase happened before the events of Hounded.)Oberon is especially effective in the audio version I listened to, narrated by Luke Daniels. This is partly because there are rarely any dialog tags for Oberon (his interruptions are set apart by lt;gt; in the text) and partly because Mr. Daniels makes Oberon actually sound like a big dog. So, when the book is read aloud, the lack of “Oberon said” really makes it sound like Oberon is making comments in the background.Besides the characters, I loved the mix of the modern with ancient mythologies in Hounded. Kevin Hearne’s contemporary setting near ASU is completely convincing (someday I’ve got to stop for fish and chips at Rúla Búla), but so are the ancient and mythological aspects of the novel.Hounded was a great read — a wonderful hero with the perfect sidekick, colorful secondary characters, and just the right sense of humor. I’ll be immediately starting the next novel in the Iron Druid Chronicles, Hexed.

I don't enjoy the humor in this one nearly as much. Jim Butcher has me laughing out loud at least several times during a novel. This one I chuckled internally a few times, but that was it.There are several other similarities that seem to be taken right from the pages of the later books of Dresden.

So it was shocking to me that I enjoyed this so much when there isn’t any! I credit that to the highly entertaining and quick-witted Atticus O’Sullivan!

Loved his encounters with Emily the witch! There’s lot of witty humor and laughs, and it was a treat being in Atticus’ head.

Nice to follow a druids adventures in an urban fantasy instead of a werewolf, vampire or a witch. Of course, all of those are in the book, but I don’t mind. A druid Is something new.

It seems like more and more if I want to find something truly new, unique and worth my time, recommendations from friends, rather real world or on-line, are far more fruitful and promising than anything the big-box book retailers are pushing these days.Case in point--Kevin Hearne's \"Hounded.\"An urban fantasy in the tradition of the Dresden Files, \"Hounded\" is a fun, refreshing story about the last of the Druids, Atticus O’Sullivan. Atticus lives in Arizona, where he runs an occult used book store and runs with his shape-shifting friend Oberon. Atticus has in his possession a certain sword that a certain other ancient god would like back and the novel chronicles the attempt to retrieve it and the battle over it.\"Hounded\" hooked me in from the first page with its sense of humor, style and wit and kept me turning the pages for the compelling story, well thought out universe and Oberon. Atticus is able to talk to Oberon telepathically and the conversations between the two (many centering on Oberon's love of sausage and his desire for French Poodles) are the highlight of the book.Reading \"Hounded\" reminded me of the first installments of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files. Atticus is a compelling, flawed hero and the novel feels like it's putting some elements into play for a larger universe that could unfold in future installments. The fact that three novels hit shelves in three months speaks well of the publisher's view of how well this series could go over. Easily one of the best urban fantasy novels of the year, \"Hounded\" is a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to more installments.

Atticus is a twenty-one centuries old druid who lives quietly undercover as an Arizona occult bookshop owner. His neighbors think he's 21 and I have to say that he comes off more as a 21 year old than someone who is centuries old. In this first book in the series a Celtic god who wants a sword that Atticus owns has finally tracked him down, shattering his peaceful Arizona existence.I found the first 80 or so pages of Hounded to be rather dull. After that the story became more interesting and I began to enjoy it. I do see the comparison to Dresden but Atticus did not pull me into the story from the beginning the way Harry did. It took me a lot longer to care about Atticus, but eventually I liked him. I appreciated the humor in the book and liked a couple of the secondary characters, namely Oberon and Granuaile. I do think this series has the potential to be really good in future books. I liked that the action scenes didn't go on and on. They made me worry about the characters without dragging on forever. I also liked that the book was relatively short. Despite the first part that I found kind of dull, it felt like it got to the point without a lot of nothing happening in the middle. One thing that was rather tedious to me was all of the hard to pronounce names. When I read a book I want to know how the names are pronounced, but even after looking at the pronunciation I kept forgetting how to pronounce some of them because there were so many to remember. I may continue on with this series, but I'm not feeling the need to do so right now.Visit my blog at https://writingsofareader.blogspot.com/"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.250087"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.250087"]]

He is funny and turns an otherwise OK story into something much, much better. Read this book for Oberron if nothing else.Oh well, 4 out of 5 stars. Very fun read.

Atticus is a bit of a Marty Stew/Mary Sue. Of course he's 2100 year old, last-of-his-kind, super powerful, handsome, knows more about magic than even the Gods themselves. He's got powerful allies, powerful enemies, and really powerful magic sword! And a wise-cracking side-kick dog.For all of that, it was fun. Witty, slim, no getting bogged down in boring bits. The world building was a bit slapdash, but it was fun and looked like it had plenty of room to grow into something more nuanced and serious. And then, about 1/3 of the way through the book, I noticed something.Women, in this world, are mostly hot/sexy, they either want Atticus or are stupidly evil, and they are pretty much all manipulative bitches. Don't believe me? I took notes!The Morrigan -- gets naked in the first scene, writhes nude against his leg, tells him she is going to have him, kills random stoners for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, in the end, betrays their mutual secret to his arch enemy just so that she doesn't have to see him in tir na nog. What a manipulative bitch!Flidas -- Sleeps with him to try to find the sword, so dumb she can't understand electricity, uses her powers to mind rape Oberon into killing a human, tried to do the same to Atticus, kidnaps the werewolf and Oberon. What a manipulative bitch!Brigid -- Sets up the whole damned plot just to get Atticus to take out her brother. Even though he worships her! Because she's too much a coward to do it herself, even though she's the Queen of the Gods or whatever! What a manipulative bitch!Emily -- What a manipulative bitch! A stupid evil and mindless manipulative bitch, who is no match for Atticus and he dominates her at every turn. The horribly offensive insult that he slings at her? Telling her to take off her fake skin and show her \"real age\". Because insulting a woman's looks is the most devastating thing you can do? A bit rich coming from a man who has seen two millennia -- but he's really honestly 21 years old and witches aren't -- they just... uh... use glamour? It's not clear. But clearly it's inferior to his method. Laksha -- Has traffic with demons, kills callously (as opposed to all the soul searching he does about his murders), and did it all for no good reason! (Except to gain power while trapped in a brutally repressive society that literally treated women as chattel. But no mention of that.) No, he just gets her away from him because she's an evil manipulative bitch!Radomilla -- is a witch. Witches all \"dominate and destroy.\" There's no explanation of why all witches are evil mothers, he doesn't say they get their power from demons or anything. No. They just all are. OMG, women with power (who don't want to boff him) are all evil in his world! What's more, she sets the whole thing up to gain power for her coven! And is so stupid that she fails entirely! What a manipulative bitch!Sorority girls -- Even though we never actually see them, we find out that \"sorority girls\" buy his anti-Viagra to break up with boyfriends, so they don't have to do it themselves. What a bunch of manipulative bitches!There are three exceptions -- Graunuaile. Who is hot and flirts with him. But is described at various times as \"meek\" and \"overwhelmed\" and of course Atticus winds up as her \"master\" and she's his servant/student/apprentice.The widow, who depends upon him to help her out, is a drunk, and says she'd jump his bones if she could. (I would be shocked if, later in the series, she turns out to be a goddess or ancient in disguise, btw. Totally shocked. )And Malina. Malina is the only decent female in this whole book. And even she is a witch, has a charm on her hair (what a manipulative bitch!), murky motivations, and is stupid enough that half her coven pulled one over on her without her knowledge.Seriously, couldn't one of the lawyers been a female? One of the customers? His employee? Maybe he hires a middle-aged overweight lesbian? One of the cops? Hell, one of the fae assassins who gets sent after him? No, of course not. He couldn't imagine a female with whom there isn't a sexual/power struggle relationship. Even his casual language is un-necessarily misogynistic. Drug addicts come out of the \"sooty petticoats\" of the Industrial Revolution. He's hiding from evil monotheists who want to kill him in the \"skirts\" of the Holy Roman Empire. And then, as the cherry on the sundae, there's the fact that he literally buys his dog a harem of in-heat French Poodles. Oh, look. Females are the mindless sexy treat (and comic relief) that you get after you do a good deed!Bah.

He has been hounded for centuries by a god who wants the sword Atticus picked up in an ancient battle. Atticus has made good use of his long life by discovering techniques that enhance his own magic, which comes from the earth. He has a vampire and a werewolf for lawyers. He is always on guard against the witches he hates. He has an Irish wolfhound for a friend, whom he taught to mind speak with him. Atticus entertains several female gods and consequently has an active sex life, although we only see the periphery.This book is about Atticus having to fight a god for the sword, and his interactions with his acquaintences along the way. Fae politics are full of double-dealing and backstabbery.

Fortunately, Atticus had picked up some friends along the way (i.e., gods, wolves and a vampire)who will help him with his enemies. I was a little worried when starting this book that I would be bogged down with background info on druidic lore and jargon. Whenever an author picks an obscure culture/group to write about, they have to teach the reader about that culture and I've read some books where the story ends for me before it begins because of the onslaught of info. That is not a problem in this book. Kevin Hearne does a great job keeping your attention without overwhelming you with unnecessary information.

In a bit of a weird coincidence, about a week after I finally broke down and bought myself a copy, I won my first Goodreads giveaway in almost three years. First, I was very excited. Then I was a bit shouty, because dammit, I just paid $9 for that same book!Anyway, no matter how I got a copy, I very much enjoyed the book.Hounded, the first book of a projected nine in the Iron Druid Chronicles, follows 2,100 year old Atticus O’Sullivan (real name Siodhachan O Suileabhain). Atticus is the last of his kind, an honest to blog druid from the old country, and one who has known gods and goddesses personally. Now he’s hiding out in the deserts of Arizona, running an occult bookshop, with only his enchanted Irish Wolfhound, Oberon, knowing who he really is. The plot of the book is pretty standard urban fantasy, really. Monsters and gods and witches and such are real, living in hiding amongst humans. There’s a lot of action and sassiness, and Hearne adds in one secondary character in particular who it looks like is going to stick around permanently, and I pretty much loved her right away. The book was a bit shaky in parts, but I was expecting that with a first novel, and all told, knowing how these kinds of series can evolve over multiple books, it’s a very promising start. My main evidence for this is my initial apathy/near dislike of the Dresden Files, which has since morphed into extreme love. (And I liked this first book much, much more than I liked Storm Front.)I had to force myself not to run out and get the next couple of books in the series, and that’s evidence enough of my liking for it. I have way too many books I still want to read this year, so the rest of these puppies will have to wait until 2015. I shall anticipate doing so. (Anticipation is delicious.)July 2014: Once I got past the initial awkwardness, this was a really fun read. I can't wait to read the sequels next year. (Forcing myself to hold off until then. Have too many books to get to this year!)

He’s funny and loyal and has a thing for re-reacting characters from films he’s watched or historical figures from Atticus’ stories“She's kind of like a Mary Poppins just before she turns to the dark side of the Force,\" Oberon said.

The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully!”\n  Oberon when he's excited :D2.\\tAtticus! He’s an honest to god druid, and not the creepy, white wearing robe kind. He is over 2000 year old, kicks ass and has a great sense of humor\n  3.\\tHis lawyers. You don’t want to mess with them, they will eat you. Literally and figuratively :D“Whoa. He had ghouls on speed dial. My lawyer kicks so much ass.”4.\\tThe Goddesses. All of them are conniving and powerful and really know how to get what they want.When you're in the middle of a killing field and the fucking Chooser of the Slain tells you to do something, you do it.

Atticus is just a downright likeable, noble guy with a less wry, sarcastic sense of humor than Dresden (which really started grating on me and was the main reason I quit reading the Dresden books; Harry's just too damn whiny, but Atticus is a go-with-the-flow ass-kicker). HOUNDED also has a lot of cool secondary characters and sweet villains (we're talking gods and goddesses, werewolves, witches, etc.), and the more I thought about the weaving storyline and well-researched backstory -- integrating not just Celtic mythos but a global variety -- the more I just really, really liked HOUNDED.

Once the story got going the pacing was good, the situations interesting, the characters fun. I loved the dog and how even though he has been upgraded in intelligence, he retains a totally dog-like personality. I also liked (for a change!) the moral ambiguity of Atticus mostly because it wasn't so ambiguous, just compared to humans. His devotion is to the Earth and her bounty. He has lived for 2,100 years and it makes sense that he doesn't really have anything in common with humans, except an ancient shriveled Irish woman from the Old Country (she is my second favorite character after the dog). He doesn't dislike humans, they just aren't something he worries about, which makes total sense to me. His priorities would seem cold in a human but they fit him and he is still immensely likable. (This is coming from someone who is such a goody-two-shoes she doesn't even speed.)[I've never understood why a vampire who's lived for centuries would fall in love with a teenager (Bella, Buffy). I mean, I have only lived a few decades and I do not enjoy hanging out with high school students let alone love one romantically. Ewwwwww. Can you say pedophile vampire? (Not to knock Angel since I adore him but I think when he was cursed with a soul he was also cursed to think like a sulky and immature 20 year old, at least until he moved to LA.)]I was very pleased to find that this was not sexist at all. The women were just as strong and capable as a man. Some were evil and one or two good and most just as morally ambiguous as he. This was particularly nice seeing as the book was obviously written by a man (in case you were reading it without the back cover or something): the protagonist's libido is constantly an issue, the women are all gorgeous and sex is always just below the surface, the hero is weakened but never afraid and he is always strong with few doubts. When he is shot in the chest, coughing up blood, the other characters, even the ones who don't know he is magic and can heal themselves are ridiculously banal along the lines of \"bummer man, hey look you ruined your favorite shirt!\" I found that scene to be really strange and anticlimactic. I think if Hearne had allowed his characters to have any kind of feeling for more than a minute the story would infinitely improve. I felt distances in a way, or maybe just emotionally numb. I certainly didn't cry out \"No!\" as I am wont to do when I am in love with a character who is in really dire jeopardy. (For my self-incriminating and embarrassing admission of having a crush on a character in a book you'll just have to read some of my other reviews to find out who and how much. I will not admit to a crush on other characters since that might irreparable label me as some kind of sexual deviant.

He’s been lying low for a while, running his occult bookshop in Arizona and romping with his Irish wolfhound, Oberon. Back in the distant past, though, he absconded with a sword that the god Aenghus Og wants for his own. Now Aenghus has found him and is sending his goons to take the sword back.Atticus is a fun character. He’s a mixture of old and new, wise and youthful. His slang is a blend of the ancient and the current. At times you can sense the years weighing on him, and he has a certain degree of paranoia that explains how he’s survived the millennia. At other times he seems closer to the age he appears, especially when it comes to his weakness for pretty women. Perhaps most importantly, he’s witty, which makes him a great character to spend a book with. His narrative voice is often hilarious. Oberon is a delight, too; he may be smarter than the average dog, but he’s utterly undone by sausages, belly rubs, and attractive French poodles.The Irish-mythology aspect is very well done. Kevin Hearne has done his homework, and these aspects of the story feel perfectly rooted in the myths themselves. For example, when Atticus reveals the secret of his longevity, I think I actually said “OH!” aloud. It makes impeccable mythic sense.The plot of Hounded is pretty straightforward, and the book is not very long. It does serve, though, to introduce Atticus, his world and its rules, and the major players, and it moves Atticus into a position where he’ll have plenty of chances to find more trouble (and more story hooks) as the Iron Druid series continues."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.309568"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.309568"]]

I absolutely loved everything about Hounded; from the male POV, to the phenomenal narrator, to Oberon, the wise cracking Irish wolfhound. The story is a nice blend of old Celtic mythology and modern adventure which proves to be an incredibly addictive combination.I always enjoy reading Urban Fantasy novels written by male authors; they are few and far between so I find it refreshing when I get to experience a story that’s told from the opposite sex’s perspective. Hearne does a fabulous job of developing Atticus’ character. I loved the contrasts between his ancient druid past and his 21 year old occult shop owner reality. New and old comes together seamlessly to create a very unique world that’s overflowing with Celtic gods, fascinating mythology and epic battles. I thoroughly enjoyed Hearne’s keen sense of humour and there’s a nice sprinkling of fun pop culture references as well.I don’t think Brilliance Audio could have picked a better narrator than Luke Daniels for this series. I loved his reading of Atticus’ POV and thought that he really succeeded in capturing the essence of The Iron Druid Chronicles. I especially adored the dialogues between O’Sullivan and his Irish wolfhound, Oberon; Daniels really brings Hearne’s characters to life and delivers more than a few laugh-out-loud moments. The only thing that frustrated me about his narration was his ability to effortlessly pronounce mouthfuls like “Tuatha Dé Danann” but butcher household names such as Roosevelt.The plot is complex and engaging thanks to its multifaceted Celtic mythology; there’s a stream of big bads that get progressively worse as the story unfolds. I enjoyed learning more about the various gods and goddesses and, found it hilarious every time one of them hit on Atticus. This lowly druid sure does get around! There’s definitely more action than sex in this tale but there’s enough of the latter to help make things extra interesting. I’m not sure if Hearne will be able to top this stellar first installment but I’m definitely sticking around to find out.Hounded was love at first listen!

You don’t see a lot of books, especially SFF, set anywhere in Arizona. It’s an intriguing place for an Irish Druid like Atticus (real name: Siodhachan—-easier to pronounce than it looks, but the alias is easier to spell) to live. It was funny but made total sense that one of the reasons Atticus’ neighbour distrusts him is Atticus doesn’t own a car. You’d practically have to be supernatural or a triathlete to get around Phoenix (or most Western cities, Albuquerque included) that way; and people expect other people to have cars. All of the descriptions of the setting are good.I liked Atticus’ Irish wolfhound, Oberon, a lot, too. They have a cute boy-and-his-faithful-dog relationship, augmented by their ability to communicate telepathically. Oberon’s “dialogue” is often hilarious. I laughed out loud when he said a witch was like Mary Poppins about to go over to the Dark Side.The fight scenes were well choreographed; and Atticus’ Druid abilities, drawing power from the Earth, are interesting.I liked the old Irish widow Atticus does yard work for and visits with.But I didn't understand why Atticus kept getting mixed up with witches if he so distrusts them. He also gets hoodwinked by goddesses, despite referring to how he’s craftily survived for 2100 years.I’ve liked some other brash characters, but I didn’t end up with a book-crush on Atticus. His particular combination of Earth-loving dude and badass warrior doesn’t quite work for me. Atticus also comes off a touch too boastful (there is a fair amount of boasting in the old Irish tales, so I guess that’s authentic) and somewhat of a chauvinist at times (women seem to fall into the categories of hot, scary, and/or old). His reliance on lawyers (who happen to be a werewolf and a vampire) struck me as a bit odd."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.315440"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.315440"]]

Living in Tempe, Arizona, going about his business, quietly of running a small shop that specializes in books of the occult variety and medicinal teas. To everyone, Atticus looks like a normal, handsome twenty something guy, but in reality he is a skilled Druid who has survived for centuries, a large part due to his magical necklace that took him nine hundred years to craft. What starts as a seemingly ordinary, hotter than Hades day in Arizona quickly turns dangerous. Outside his store, a group of paranormal thugs attack Atticus. The steely warrior soon disposes of them, but not before he learns they were sent by his biggest enemy, Aenghus ‘Og. The attackers are after the magical sword, Fragarach. A sword forged in the Tir na nOg, the Fae Realm. As soon as he finishes cleaning the mess up, a large black crow, harbinger of death, or better known as The Morrigan arrives in his store. She and Atticus struck a bargain centuries ago that allows for his longevity. Even the Morrigan is concerned for Atticus’ well being. Trouble hangs thick on the wind. Can Atticus once again escape the deadly fury of Aenghus Og or are his days, as everyone seems to think, truly numbered?What I Liked:*I was completely blown away by this book. Atticus is an awesome hero. A Druid skilled in magic, herbs, shapeshifter, healing power and he draws his energy from the earth. Not only is he a kick butt character, but he is witty and a bit sarcastic as well. The other great thing about him, is that he has a large Irish Wolfhound, Oberon, with whom he communicates telepathically. Let me just say, Oberon steals the show with all of his hilarious dialogue on sausages, arse sniffing, French poodle harems and Ghanghis Kahn. Oberon is on my list of all time favorite side kicks.*I loved how this book immediately opens with action and it doesn’t let up. Each chapter piles on more trouble for Atticus until he is neck deep in hot water. There are so many developments and twists in the plot that you don’t get bored. I also loved the fact that you were constantly trying to figure out who were the good guys and who were the baddies. *I loved meeting Atticus’ neighbor the old widow, Mrs. MacDonagh. This old gal is full of sass and spunk. She is lucky enough to have Atticus do her yard work and while he works in the yard, she sits on the porch and makes inappropriate comments. The best part about her is that she tosses back some neat whiskey before church. She is so fun, I hope she is in the rest of the series.*I enjoyed having a male protagonist that is a Druid. I know very little about Druids and Celtic lore and Mr. Hearne helped my dive into his world and gain a new appreciation. *Starting this book, I was expecting a read set in a fantasy world, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book was set in my former home of Metro Phoenix. So I was familiar with the setting and many of the places in the story. I liked that Mr. Hearne set his urban fantasy book in our modern world, but there are plenty of paranormal entities who live among us and go unnoticed. This book has werewolves, vampires, Celtic Gods, Fae, and witches to name a few. Expect the unexpected in this book.*This book avoids my arch nemeses: the horrendous cliffhanger and the love triangle. Thankfully, both of these elements are out of this book. So if you are looking for a read that does not involve that love angle theme, read Hounded.*The best part about reading this book, is that I read it in a month long read along event with many other bloggers. It is fun to read a book with fellow bloggers and compare notes along the way. And The Not So Much:*Honestly, there are only a couple of minor considerations. First, this book is jam packed with Irish lore and language. It is a lot to take in and keep track of, but Mr. Hearne does an excellent job of helping you stay afloat. He even provides a nice list and pronunciation guide at the beginning, to help you make sense of everything.*There is a section in the book where Atticus discusses all that goes into becoming a Druid. I enjoyed learning all of this, but I wish that there was a bit more, again just because I am unfamiliar with Druids and Celtic Lore.*This book builds and builds toward a deadly showdown with the antagonist, Anghus ‘Og, but when you finally get to those last chapters, it kind of felt a bit anti-climatic. I won’t go into much detail to avoid spoilers, but the big epic battle felt a bit hurried. Not to say that it wasn’t entertaining, it was, I was just a little surprised at how quickly Atticus ran into difficulty. *Finally, maybe this is just me, but when I saw the cover I thought this book doesn’t look like it is for me. I don’t tend to read too many fantasy books. This is a case of don’t judge a book by its cover, thinking this is a book for men. Ladies, do not hesitate to read this. This book is awesome and it will appeal to a wide variety of readers. There is a little something in it for everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and cannot wait to continue the series. Hounded, is a fantastic book. Follow the resourceful Atticus as he fights to stave off his mortal enemy. Be on your toes because this book is action packed and full of awesomeness. The lovable Oberon will sink his teeth into your heart with all of his hilarious commentary. If you are thinking of reading this book but haven’t gotten around to it, get after it NOW! If you have never heard of this book and want something fun, get this NOW! Books two and three are currently available and book four, Tricked, will be released April 24, 2012.

Set in an alternate timeline, it’s a supernatural jaunt, with werewolves, witches and what not. It’s fun, with lots of witty dialogue between Atticus O’Sullivan and Oberon, his dog, who can talk. If I'm honest I was concerned I was going to be reading a typical urban fantasy novel – that being one of Caligula’s bacchanalia romps. Thankfully not!The essence of the story goes something like this; Atticus a 2100 year old druid, stole a sword named Fragarach [the Answerer] from Aenghus Og, a rather detestable god, even for the one who represents love. Atticus has been on the run for over 1000 years and decides, while no, actually is forced to go “balls out” as he so elegantly puts it, against his would be assassin’s. Throw in a few other gods, a witches’ coven along with werewolves and a rather polite vampire, then we've got the basics of the story.Have you ever come across that writer who seems unable to write believable dialogue between characters? The type that makes you pull that Harrison Ford face, wherein you read something and think, really? You know the face that he plays from Decker to Han Solo. I'm sure you do. Kevin Herne has a real gift, given this is his first novel in the Iron Druid Chronicles. Conversations between Atticus and his Irish Wolfhound are brilliant, they just zip off the page and bound along. It’s really rare for me to chuckle away to myself while reading, so bravo. Speaking of Oberon, he is by far the best dog-character I’ve come across. He beats Scooby, Pluto and even Brian from Family Guy. I mean Brian is OK if you like the British pompous-pomp he regards for wit.So what of Atticus – well he is badass, even for a druid. He draws his power (literally) from the Earth. He looks 21, not bad for a 2100 years old. Certainly moans like a 21 year old. He owns a shop in Arizona called Third Eye Books which sales herbs and various occult items – standard stuff for a university tow, let’s be honest. Perry is his one and only employee, a massive goth who reminded me of Spike from Buffy – in regards to his persona anyway. One of Atticus’s closes friends is Widow MacDonagh, who lives a few doors down from him in a quint suburb in Arizona – she hates the Brits and loves whiskey. Sounds Irish to me. As I've mentioned, Atticus having Fragarach (an actual sword from Irish legend) sets of a chain of events that have him fighting for his life. On the way we meet several interesting personalities, The Morrigan, who I believe is the Celtic God for slain. She has that rare ability to be both darkly beautiful and scary as hell at the same time. Yes, I've been to plenty of rock/metal gigs, so know the type. The type I’ve met don’t have the ability to change into a squawking crow at will. The Morrigan has helped Atticus in the past, namely with the ‘borrowing’ of Fragarach. They've a very ‘urban’ relationship, In the sense that they flirt outrageously. Two other interesting characters were the werewolf/vampire-lawyer team Hal and Leif. Both former Vikings – both allies of Atticus – mainly because his blood is a rare vintage – like Moet you say? No, try a rare vintage of Dom Perignon. Well they enjoy a glass of vintage Atticus, let’s put it like that. One of Hounded best appeals is also its worst. Characters. For just under 300 pages it gets bogged down in the amount of characters showing up at Atticu’s door. It got on my nerves towards the end – I mean the finale was afoot and before Atticus could get there, two Gods turn up separately to impart their wisdom and a phone call warning him of further danger. This, while a few of his friends are in danger and he is less than a mile or two away. I was thinking, if I wanted your pearls of wisdom I would have asked for them when I saw you previously. Are there other pitfalls. I mean it’s urban fantasy, c’mon Stu! Well, no, would be the short answer, there aren't. It’s a really good read. There I said it. I complimented a Urban Fantasy novel. Now I’ll go eat some humble pie. ALL OF IT!Hounded has certainly had spit and polish applied aplenty, it was a debut novel, so they tend to have a lot of hours focused upon them. It’ll be interesting to see how Kevin Hearne’s novels progress, not just in plot but how he handles releasing yearly additions to the series. I’ve got to say I was pleasantly surprised given some of the tags urban fantasy has – rightly so with some authors, dig your own self-fulfilling prophecy why’dont’cha. Kevin Hearne breathes life into some myths and makes some believable, others, not so much. Aenghus Og comes to mind, the God of Love. Hmm, in no way convinced. But then Gods don’t really exist, it’s all a fictional tale, just like this one. Right? Who knows.

A unique urban fantasy with a Celtic bent, the Chronicles follow Atticus, the planet’s last and certainly most charming Druid. This young Irish lad – well, he looks twenty-one, but he’s actually a couple of millennia old – has plenty of enemies scattered around the globe, but he just wants to spend his days working at an occult bookshop in Arizona with his talking Irish wolfhound. Unfortunately the badass Celtic god of love is in serious need of his old magic sword, and Atticus really doesn’t want to return it…Breezy, hilarious and totally addictiveTold in first person by Atticus himself, Hounded can’t be put down. I read it in less than a day. Atticus is sassy, no-nonsense, and unremorseful in going off on his own personal rants in the middle of a conversation (the difficulty in finding a perfect fish’n’chips, anyone?). The combination of a modern world with old school Celtic mythology (and a few other pantheons, too) is brilliant, and Atticus’s voice, though definitely Irish, doesn’t veer into an unintelligible dialect. The novel’s concept is similar to Neil Gaiman’s American Gods, but it’s made original by Atticus’s light-hearted storytelling and his outsider status from every social circle (mortal, godly, witching, lupine …) he encounters. Hounded is the kind of book that you put down, wrinkle your nose and say “Gee! Why didn’t I think of that?”If you think Atticus is great, wait ‘til you meet Oberon.The beauty of Hounded isn’t in Atticus’s narration, though. Not at all. Hounded’s charm lies entirely in the secondary characters: Oberon, the lovable Irish wolfhound; Leif, an Icelandic vampire-attorney, and his many werewolf co-workers; a hot Irish bartender possessed by a Hindu witch; Mrs. MacDonagh, a neighborly Irish widow who’s fine to let you bury a corpse in her yard, so long as the dead arse is British; and the list goes on. Hearne treads a perfect line between hilarious quirks and real depth, and even the goofiest sideshow character is easy to care for after you get to know her a little.The plot itself: predictable, but still funThere aren’t too many surprises in Hounded. In fact, the one time I thought I’d pegged a good surprise coming up, it turned out that Hearne didn’t even take advantage of the opportunity. Instead Hounded employs your typical action-adventure formula: suspense, killing, mystery, revelation, suspense, killing … You get the idea. Some later plot elements came out of left-field – demons, for one thing (don’t worry, that’s not a spoiler) – but they weren’t the real mind-blowing surprise you’ll find in some thrillers.That’s all right, though. Events move so quickly – and the writing, sex, and violence are all so dazzling – that you’ll hardly have the time to notice. Besides, the characters and the witty narrative are why you’ll pick up and read this book anyway.Why should you read this book?You might not be able to tell, but I’m actually restraining myself in this review. This book is wonderful! It’s got oodles of personality, lots of action, and a hunky Irishman on the cover. What more could you want? Hearne does a surprisingly believable job of mishmashing world cultures and mythologies into one madcap, witty, intelligent adventure with a cast you’ll fall in love with. Hounded doesn’t have the meaty substance of high literature, but it’s certainly worthier fare than most of what you’ll find in the urban fantasy section of your bookstore these days."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.355124"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.355124"]]

I particularly liked that character motivations were not always obvious and the gods were clearly working for their own ends, using humans as pawns and playing both sides of the conflict. While the one sex scene was awkward it was mercifully brief, thankfully short on detail and non-recurring. I like a good sex scene as much as the next person but it's become a joke in urban fantasies. The best character (with belief firmly suspended) is Oberon.Also? Thank you, Mr. Hearne, for NOT using the 'my character was raped' trope (yes, this can happen to men). It's become sickeningly over-used in urban fantasies. There are other ways to develop conflict and character depth.Cons: The story contains one-dimensional, predictable characters and quite a few scenes seem more geared toward showing off how cool Atticus is than advancing the plot. There is never a moment where Atticus' ability to overcome his enemies is in doubt and there is never a cost for using his abilities. Sleeping on grass isn't a cost, it's a camp out. Magic that powerful requires a heavy cost, otherwise he's nothing more than a comic book super hero without the Kryptonite. Magic auto-magically saves the day repeatedly, and sometimes unbelievably.The ancient, powerful magical beings that populate this story have no gravitas, no 'otherness' to them. Granted, the goddesses and gods of the ancient world behaved little differently than humans according to their myths. That doesn't mean they're not alien, strange, and frightening beings. As they're portrayed here they come across as mundane jokes; another reason it's hard to believe Atticus is ever in any danger from the whole lot of them.Another problem I had was the 'all female witches are evil' trope. Atticus has one friend who gets screwed over by one witch in 2,100 years and that makes all witches evil? For a being as theoretically steeped in observations of human behavior as Atticus claims to be, this view is incredibly myopic. If all myths are true in this world than there are going to be 'good' witches as well as bad ones. Let's hope that Malina and her followers are given the chance to represent for the 'good' witches.And that brings me to the most problematic issue. The male characters are divided into good (Atticus, Oberon, Hal, Leif, Perry) and evil (Fagles, Bres, Aengus Og). The delineation is unequivocal. All the female characters are portrayed as evil and/or untrustworthy with the exception of two characters; Granuaile, who is literally a female-shaped vessel for something Atticus considers evil and untrustworthy, and Mrs. MacDonagh, the incredulous drunken neighbor lady with a possible IRA past. She will likely be killed off in a later book to generate sympathy or turn out to be, you guessed it, untrustworthy and/or evil, having lulled Atticus into complacency with her incredulous drunkenness. And don't get me started on the weak explanation for Granuaile's desire to be a druid. I think it's good to see male authors dive into the urban fantasy pool. It's a genre in need fresh perspectives and male primary protagonists. However, I'd rather not see the same tired gender tropes played out as well. If good and evil are going to be so simplistic, let's see some unequivocally good female characters without the qualifiers of 'drunk' or 'hand puppet'."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.357960"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.357960"]]

So, we have a plethora of secondary characters who range from bone-crunching/blood-sucking (literally) attorneys to lying bitchy withes to socially inept gods/fae to a sexy double personality bartender, who happen to fight with him or against him.There is no romance in Hounded. But it doesn't need it to keep me interested. That is how good this book is. Atticus is an amazingly sexy hero. I spent most of the book drooling over him, because he was a) a sexy druid, b) a strong fighter, c) a respectful, knowledgeable gentleman, d) a dog person and e) a funny guy. I loved his brain and his thoughts.Oberon stole the show many times during this book. He may not be the main protagonist, but I am sure that everyone would enjoy this wolfhound's contributions the most. The secondary characters were really interesting, adding so much flavor and story to the book. They were not at all caricatures of their 'race'. The werewolf and vampire attorney's were really badass, saving Atticus in anything requiring legal maneuvering. I liked the Morrigan, oddly. She's so weird, but I enjoyed every scene with her in it. I was constantly befuddled by the witches, and I was extensively glad that Atticus never trusts them.About the narrator - Luke Daniels. He was amazing, portraying Atticus and everyone really. The personality he gave Atticus's words was really worthwhile and added a lot to the story (which was already stellar). I'm glad I listened to the audiobook version and highly recommend it.Overall, this was such a stellar book that I would recommend it to anyone is a heartbeat. I'm trying to get my brother to read it (since it doesn't have any pesky romantic scenes), but he has no time with marching season, IB classes and college apps. Anyway, I am definitely going to read the 2nd and 3rd books of the series. There's no cliffhanger to compel readers to continue, but after reading such an amazing book, I figure there is no need. We know its only going to get better.

If you're not familiar with it, you may want to check it out if you're a fan of Jim Butcher, Rob Thurman, Joss Whedon, and/or Irish mythology. For urban fantasy, I would rank this right alongside The Dresden Files, the Cal Leandros series, Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, and Angel, and coming from me that is extremely high praise. I can't come up with a better way to recommend this book than that!The series kicks off with Hounded which stars Atticus O'Sullivan, the last Druid. He's really 21 centuries old, but he doesn't mind if you assume he's only 21, the age he looks, and an American for that matter. He runs an occult bookstore/tea shop, shapeshifts, and practices magic through the power he draws from the earth. Mind you, though, he's not a witch; he hates witches and doesn't trust them. By the way, he also has a magical sword called Fragarach, the Answerer, and this sword attracts trouble. Aengus Og, Celtic God of Love, is after Fragarach and has been for centuries, but he decides that now it's time to step up his game and get serious about taking it from Atticus.Hounded is action-packed, clever, geeky, and absolutely hilarious. I loved the supporting cast, especially Oberon and the Widow MacDonagh. Oberon stole the show and has some excellent dialog. Actually the dialog was pretty great throughout and Luke Daniels is an excellent narrator. Some favorite lines include: \"I just stared at him like he was trying to sell me the ShamWow and the Slap Chop for only $19.99\" - Atticus O'Sullivan“'She's kind of like a Mary Poppins just before she turns to the dark side of the Force....Let go of your anger, Malina! There's still good in you! The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully!'\" - Oberon\"'Toto didn't deserve that kind of trauma. He was so tiny.'\" -Oberon“Monty Python is like catnip for nerds. Once you get them started quoting it, they are constitutionally incapable of feeling depressed.” -Atticus O'Sullivan“'Yer a good lad, Atticus, mowin’ me lawn and killin’ what Brits come around.'” -Widow MacDonagh“What sealed the deal for me was that the cloak wouldn't come off without a generous donation of my tears. Those used to be almost impossible for me to summon, I admit, until I watched Field of Dreams. When Kevin Costner asks his dad at the end if he'd like to have a catch, I just completely lose my shit.” -Atticus O'Sullivan"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.363841"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.363841"]]

Hay personas que viven en mundos extremadamente pequeños, y hay quienes viven en un mundo de posibilidades infinitas.\"\nSiempre he adorado leer sobre mitología, todas ellas, pero la celta y la nórdica son mis favoritas. La acciones de sus dioses tenían más sentido para mi que las de los greco-romanos. El problema de leer libros de este tipo es que humanizan a los dioses, o los rebajan a las sencillas emociones humanas, o los hacen actuar como adolescentes hormonales o como seres de infinita dulzura. Lo primero que adore de este libro en que no cae en esos típicos recursos.Los Tuatha Dé Danann (dioses irlandeses) presentados aquí son egoístas, banales y piensan en su propio beneficio, no les importa utilizar a los demás y las vidas humanas les importan bastante poco.Y creo que ese fue uno de los detonantes para que amara este libro. Es atrapante y no da respiro alguno. El libro es una sucesión tras otra de situaciones, relacionadas entre sí, mezclada de manera amena con explicaciones sobre este mundo dónde se mezclan absolutamente todas las culturas y mitologías. En este universo no existe un solo panteón, sino todos ellos y, al mismo tiempo, también existen diferentes realidades propias de cada uno e incluso sus propios infiernos.Nuestro protagonista, Atticus es un druida de dos milenios que lleva mucho tiempo huyendo de Aenghus Ôg el dios celta del amor, a quién le robo la espada Fragarach. La trama comienza cuando el dios descubre el escondite de Atticus y enviá a sus esbirros a asesinarlo. Todo comienza a complicarse cuando más Tuatha Dé Danann comienzan a involucrarse y entran en escena hombres lobos, vampiros y brujas.Desde ese momento, el libro desborda acción y aventura, tampoco escasea en humor. Atticus suele verle un sentido irónico a todos sus intentos de asesinato y su genial perro, Oberon, siempre tiene alguna replica divertida.No hay momentos de relleno y el libro usa la cantidad de páginas exactas para desarrollar la trama. De igual modo, no hay explicaciones innecesarias, ni personajes de relleno, todo cumple su rol en su momento. Pero, tal vez por eso mismo, no hay una gran profundidad en ciertos personajes y situaciones que son pasadas por encima. Fue una lectura refrescante y original, que no cae en ninguno de los típicos tópicos de la fantasía urbana. Lo recomiendo mucho para cualquiera que guste de la mitología, o desee aprender algo nuevo.Si bien el libro tiene un final bastante cerrado, ¡ya estoy deseando empezar con el siguiente! ¡Y voy a hacerlo ahora mismo!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.366507"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.366507"]]

I probably would have passed it by if not for Patrick’s review and comparison to Harry Dresden. Hearne has a similar, easily identifiable, first person style that Butcher, Scalzi and others back to Heinlein and Twain have mastered. The “aw shucks” humor; the nifty toys; the fascinating world…all are very engaging.So here we have a several thousand year old druid. Maybe, he is the last of his kind and known as Atticus O’Sullivan plunked-down in Tempe, Arizona, running a bookstore. This location allows Hearne to explore ancient and new wave intersections as well as blend the college scene with urban elements such as bars, lawyers, and cops and explore the unusual ecosystem of the area. As a druid, Atticus, is pledged to protect the earth (and the earth’s creatures) and he draws his strength from his contact with the soil. So what is a druid? Here is Hearne’s version (though not offered directly by Atticus): “They are healers and wise people…Tellers of tales, repositories of culture, shape-shifters, according to some stories, and able to exert a little influence over the weather…Occasionally they kicked some ass in battles.” Druids in our world left no written word of themselves. From what I have read of Celtic tradition and lore, Hearne’s druid is a more modern version steeped in as much Dungeons amp; Dragons attributes as in the historical past. Nothing, of itself, is wrong with that. This druid is easy to like and there are no rituals that take pages and pages to work through. The plot is this initial book is pretty loose. A lot of people have it in for Atticus. They range from his next door neighbor to the cops to the Tuatha De Danann to several gods. Oh yes, there are plenty of gods. In fact, according to Hearne, every god from Norse to Hindu has been around and may still be around. Getting back to the plot: Atticus has a sword that, arguably, belongs to a god. That god has been tracking him for centuries and has sent many warriors and demons to retrieve it. Atticus has been trying to live under the radar in a place in the New World where he can pass for just being eccentric. Not far into this book his cover is blown and he has to prepare himself for the coming conflict. I am betting with my four star rating that Hearne’s able to pull this all together in the coming books. He has the right touch for a storyteller and has drawn my interest. If he can channel Jim Butcher for advice, he should not have a problem."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.369224"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.369224"]]

Kevin Hearne has stepped into the Urban Fantasy genre with a fresh face, Atticus O'Sullivan, a slew of supporting characters {all worthy of their very own series}, an entertaining plot, and a hilarious side-kick... because every great hero needs a jaunty side-kick.Atticus O'Sullivan is nothing short of a stud. After 2100 years he's molded into my the ideal man, with his charm, wit, and intellect. His tales of Van Gough and his run-ins with Shakespeare sprinkle in interest regarding his past, but If you're worried that a character who's older than Christ might not come off in this twenty first century world, you shouldn't. Atticus will quickly capture your interest with his debonair personality, but his fight-scene skills will stand up against any modern day hero. His character takes everything in stride, which in-turn makes the story easy to enjoy yourself. Easily said, Atticus O'Sullivan is a hero worthy of your interest.The thing I was most surprised about was how much I laughed throughout the book. Hearne delicately balanced, what could have been a heavy story of Druidic lore who's hero has over 2100 years worth of history under his belt, with continuous chuckles from this smitten fan. Whether it be with Atticus' conversations with his Irish greyhound, Oberon, who obsesses equally over sausages, little french poodles, and personifying Genghis Khan, and quotes Wizard of Oz, or whether it by one of the many other hilarious secondary characters. My favorite secondary character might have to be the 80+ year old Irish widow, Mrs MacDonagh, who goes to church \"mellow\" and makes statements like \"Have y'buried the fecking teabag already?\" and \"Yer a good lad, Atticus, mowin' me lawn and killin' what Brits come around.\" I was just so delighted that the story was as humorous as it was adventurous.Hearne's writing flows perfectly and easily sweeps the reader away to Atticus' world. He makes creating an interesting and entertaining book seem effortless, and you'll be surprised with how quickly you'll fly through the pages. Reading a story told through a male's point of view was refreshing and I can't wait for the next two installments, due out late Spring.Bottom Line: I haven't had this much fun with a story in a long time. This series starter should be enjoyed by every fantasy reader out there.

Chapter 1 pulled me right into the book for an all nighter. Being in urban America where standing in line at Starbucks resonated well with me. Oh, and I like Irish whiskies, especially Tullamore Dew.

One using glamour looked like \n  Orlando Bloom’s Legolas, being man-pretty \n, the sort of people you see in salon product ads. They had been sent by Aenghus Óg, a Celtic god who wants his sword.During this Fae fight, Atticus dispatches them and at the conclusion of the fight the Morrigan, a death goddess, took care of five dead faeries by sending them to Manannan Mac Lir, the land of the dead. Morrigan is stark naked, and acting as a seductress caught him unprepared. She slapped him silly and his response was: \n  ”Ow, thanks for that. I was about to go into a full-on leg-humping mode.”\nDruid magic was very well described and explained showing how unique it is to make this read very fascinating. The unspoken mental conversations with Oberon were riotously funny especially when they returned from a fierce battle where Oberon was an incredible asset. Oberon detected someone in his territory and gazed out the backyard and said \n  ”French poodles!! All black and curly with poofy little tails!And every one of them is in heat!! Oh WOW!

He was fun as a narrator and I enjoyed his sarcasm and quips. I especially liked his relationship with Oberon. That was so cool. I've read a book before with a talking dog and it got really annoying after a while but this was a nice change. Oberon was an awesome sidekick and his commentary really added to the overall story that was taking place. I also liked the intro to Irish mythology. I've seen it in passing or encapsulated by the phrase Tuatha De Daanan but this is the first book I've ever read that dives really deep into the pantheon. I also like that there is potential for other mythologies from this series. Kinda like with Kate Daniels with the changing mythologies with each book. The Bad: At times I felt like Atticus was invincible. While I know he isn't, he has access to a lot of powers and that can get overwhelming at times.

All his choices to defend himself made sense. And it had lots of fun elements with gods being real a la American Gods, werewolves, vampires amp; witches without being too campy or too dark.

After happening upon the book’s description and learning about the quick release schedule of the series, I was entranced and wanted to see if Hounded would stack up against the hype it had been receiving.Hounded begins with a soliloquy by Atticus O’Sullivan who is actually a 2100-year-old Irish druid, older than the world’s largest religion and apparently the last of his kind. His real name is Siodhachan O’Suileabhain, but for reasons revealed in the blurb, he chooses to modernize himself. He gives the reader his background history in a neat manner, while fending off an attack by five of the Fae. He also learns that this attack is orchestrated by Aenghus Og, the Celtic god of Love. He beats his attackers, but is put on alert by this event since he chose Arizona for its scarcity of Oak, Ash and Thorn, which are required for the Fae/Sidhe to cross over into our realm.As Atticus contemplates their presence and the meaning of their attack, he’s interrupted by the appearance of Morrigan, the Irish War goddess and slayer of the chosen. She has been on friendly terms with Atticus since the origin of his feud, and warns him about dire omens and his impending death at the hands of Aenghus Og. The reasons for this particular feud are because Atticus, in his youth, stole the legendary sword Fragarach from Aenghus Og’s chosen champion. Atticus discusses his situation with Morrigan who inquires about his particular type of magic, which explains series’ title, and then extracts a promise from him without giving him a promise in return, leaving Atticus with a sense of foreboding.Next, Atticus is visited by Flidais, the Celtic goddess of the hunt, who relates the same tale told by Morrigan, but with an alteration as to who else is coming. Here, there is a small but important info-dump which reveals the nature of Atticus’ lawyers Hauk (a werewolf) and Lief (a vampire). Atticus agrees to go on a hunt with Flidais and Oberon, an Irish wolfhound mentally bound to Atticus. Thus begins the events which fuel the tale that is Hounded.Other subplots include a witch who requests Atticus’s apothecary skills in return for help/favour from her Coven, and the bartender Granuaile MacTiernan, who’s more than she appears to be.Kevin Hearne’s writing is competent, led by skillful prose that adds to the book’s refreshing setting and protagonist. Atticus as the narrator particularly excels. Even though he’s the hero of the story, you can discern certain moral ambivalences from his actions since Atticus is a bit of a rogue when the situation demands it. For instance, Atticus relates his own versions of various historical moments, but these accounts seem a bit shady. Overall, Atticus is lovable and trustworthy, but he’s also the sort of chap you wouldn’t want as your enemy.Humor is one of the major plus points in Hounded, with the dialogue/banter between Oberon and Atticus the highlight of the book. In particular, Oberon’s fascination with Genghis Khan, his love for Poodles and the ultimate allure of hunting, all of which increases the reader’s fun quotient.Another promising front is the multitude of mythologies utilized in the book, which are reflective of the real world. The author’s use of mythology is very smartly executed, while providing enough of an explanation to satisfy the reader’s curiosity. Lastly, the pace of the book never lets up, with Atticus going from plot point to plot point with as few breaks as possible, thus creating a sense of urgency for the reader.Negatively, the book has a bit of a PG-13 feel to it. For example, bad things occur, but the author has them wrapped up neatly to lessen their darkness. There is also quite a bit of info-dumping in the first fifty pages of the book, but since Hounded is the opening volume in a series, it was necessary for the author to lay out all this information for the reader. Plus, it was easy to overlook the info-dumping since it was presented in an entertaining manner through engaging character dialogue. Finally, urban fantasy stories tend to be predictable and Hounded does not differentiate much in that regard. It remains to be seen if Kevin Hearne will be able to deviate from the norm and give readers a more refreshing story throughout the rest of the series.CONCLUSION: Despite a few deficiencies, Hounded is a very good debut which introduces a worthy and refreshing urban fantasy setting and a clever, yet morally dubious protagonist. I was especially amazed by how polished Kevin Hearne’s debut was and anxiously look forward to reading the remainder of the series ASAP!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.418327"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.418327"]]

Especially one with a male protagonist. I don't want to speak too soon, but from the events in the book, it seems that the story will continue going in a good direction.The main guy is (obviously) a druid and he's old, like over two millennia old, and he's scary powerful. He's not focused on getting more power, though, so he's happy being left alone. The problem is that other powerful people, are not willing to let him have that peace. This is when things get interesting and I was reminded a little (this will probably seem random to most people) of Doctor Who. A very old, jaded, resourceful, powerful guy that tries to live and let live until someone forces him to go all in… usually, all hell breaks loose and things don't turn well for those people.What interested me was the way the author managed to advance the story and give us the important information without Atticus coming across as an idiot or a male Mary Sue (I refuse to use any of the silly male names for them). Writing someone with a lot of power and knowledge can be very tricky; I still remember the bad taste left after reading supposedly experienced detectives doing stupid mistakes in the course of an investigation just to forward the plot, so I'm happy that nothing like that happened here. He was given a rich background and his actions supported that. It was also refreshing not having to deal with the usual poor ignorant dude that for whatever reason is \"The Chosen One\" blundering their way through the story and learning to manage their new powers.Just as important as having a likable main character is having a good group of supporting ones. Sometimes, I think, this is even more important, especially for a first book. (view spoiler)[I never would have read past the first book in series like \"The Hollows/Rachel Morgan\" if not for the rest of the cast. Rachel was, and still sometimes is, irritating.

There are several reasons why I absolutely love this series and why I can't wait for the next and the next ... 6 books are contracted and I hope there will be more.. First of all, the humor and the voice of Atticus is phenomenal and hilarious! I was listen to the audio (which is equally fantastic) and found myself laughing out lout so so often. Definitely not save for work since people will look very strange at you when they find you laughing so loud and constantly smiling. Second, the cover in this case is a seller itself. I want to see that cover model for real, he's HOT and he's THE perfect model for Atticus. *swoon* *faints self* Third. I LOVE Druids, so sooo much! This is the kick off in a new series surrounding Atticus a 2000 year old Druid, the only Druid that is left. He's heavenly sexy , is tattooed (swoon), kick-ass awesome, funny like hell and just plain awesome! (Did I now use enough great descriptive adjectives?) He draws power from earth and runs a book shop aka Apothecary and sells \"tees\", herbs and potions... He has a powerful magic sword that he got from an ancient god which is slightly pissed that he lost his sword and sworn to take it back from Atticus. His lawyer is a Vampire and he's associated and does business with the local werewolves, hates witches and flirts with ancient Fae goddesses. Want more? The best part is, he speaks to his dog Oberon in his mind. Kuddos for naming the dog Oberon! ..duh!! Oberon's voice is equally hilarious if not even more. This dog is fantastic!!! The very best quotes truly come from him. You have to love that dog!! You would think that an ancient druid would have a different voice, but Atticus is a master in going with time and blending in. He's alive for 2000 years for a reason... He speaks like a 22 year college boy and this makes it even more fun to read! The only thing I missed was a little bit of sex. There is only the innuendo but just like in YA novels, the story stops and moves on later. I had hoped for a Urban Fantasy like this I would get a bit details, but I also respect the authors choice not to go there. (But stilll!! I bit of juicy details would have been niicceeeeeee!) have the tiny hope that there will be a bit more romance coming in the next book. (*So if you love good Urban Fantasy you have to pick this up, seriously!! It is hilarious, fun and this Druid is super sexy! This will provide an equal fantastic read for both male and female which is often not easy to provide, but Kevin Haerne managed just that! Also because of the lack of sex and only slight sexy scenes this can be read by many different age groups and most definitely can also be read by YA! ILovers of audiobooks seriously have to pick this one up, the narrator Luke Daniels is phenomenal. He is THE perfect voice for Atticus and gives him a touch that makes you love this dog even more. I Love this book, I love Atticus, love Oberon, I love Luke Daniel and I love Kevin Hearne for writing this piece of awesomeness! (You feel the love right) On a side note: I played WoW (World of Warcraft) for around 4 years and I played a Druid, I played other characters but the Druid was my one and only...- Oh my lovely Druid *sigh* and after reading this truly missed her, and this series reminds me a bit of the stories me and my Druid experienced. I hope I this won't insult the author but I absolutely enjoyed this and found myself back into this world I adored so much. Also the healing power drawn from earth was perfectly described for a Druid Priest (which I played..*wooot*) Ok, I have to count how many times I used the word love in this review, but... at least now I think you get the point!!

Harry Dresden has a possessed skull named Bob, Rachel Morgan has Jenks the pixie, and Atticus O’Sullivan has an Irish Wolfhound named Oberon. Oberon, more than any of the other well drawn characters in Kevin Hearne’s clever, Celtic mythology infused debut, HOUNDED, was my favorite. He thinks like a dog, but the way Hearne communicated those thoughts was endlessly entertaining. He had a childlike enthusiasm that came across perfectly.Atticus too had a great ‘voice.’ He struck just right balance between witty modern vernacular with the occasional ancient colloquialism that it made him 100% believable as a millennial old Druid with the body of a twenty-one year old. He had a laid back coolness factor that belied a razor sharp mind. One of the best debut protagonists I’ve read in a long time.An Arizona girl myself, it was great fun to read a book literally set in my backyard. I think I’ve been to every location mentioned in HOUNDED and can vouch for the grub at the Rula Bula Irish pub in Tempe. At the same time, because I was so familiar with the setting, it was probably harder for me to wrap my head around the idea of all these supernatural creatures living in and around my old stomping grounds.But it wasn’t the setting that kept HOUNDED from skyrocketing onto my all time favorites list, it was the plot. It’s pretty thin and takes it’s sweet time getting started. The first hundred pages or so deal primarily with Atticus getting unwanted visitors and introducing us to some of the characters who will no doubt populate the series. An old enemy wants something that Atticus stole from him centuries ago. He sends wave after wave of attackers after Atticus to get it back. That’s pretty much it. If the characters and writing style hadn’t been so compelling, the weak plot would have been a problem. Overall, a really strong debut full of primary and secondary characters who could all probably carry a series on their own, they are that good. The plot may not have been the strong suit, but the narrative style and voice of Atticus and Oberon more than made up for it. If you like a sprawling pantheon along side the more traditional urban fantasy vampires, werewolves, and witches, you’re going to love this book. The good news is that you won’t have to wait the usual six months to a year for the next Iron Druid Chronicles book.

Hm, how to explain. “Hey, it’s like Twilight, but for guys!” Oh, not so much. “Hey, look. The cover has a dude with a sword! Except he’s kinda glowing in that Twilight way, and he’s far too man-pretty.” Okay, no. “Hey, it’s got old dudes, witches, vampires, and werewolves, but not in that I-sparkle-in-the-sunlight kind of way!” Still no. “Hey, it’s about a druid, not the kind of druid who is underpowered and lame-to-play-in-most-video-games-so-no-one-does druid, but a manly druid who is really, really old, but lives in modern society, talks to his dog who talks back to him, meets a lot of really attractive girl-characters, and kills stuff with a shiny sword!” That’s probably as close a description as you’re gonna get. I don’t read a lot of urban fantasy (This might have something to do with the fact that the last urban fantasy that I read was City of Bones for our school’s Book of the Month Club. A little bit of my manhood died while reading that book.), so it’s hard for me to compare to other, similar books, but I really enjoyed this one. I appreciated the lack of teenage angst, the lack of the ubiquitous love triangle, and the lack of the nauseating “I’m-going-to-a-club-where-inevitably-bad-things-will-happen” scene.

This book is not so old and I try to keep up with trends, but for a lot of them I didn't know what the author was referring to. For example: Joe Buck haircut... Kevin Hearne should have been less specific and more descriptive.- Atticus is 21 centuries old, but has a control of a horny teenager. Whenever sexy woman is near or expresses interest in him, one part of his anatomy gets all the blood flow and Atticus is useless.- I don't like how female characters are represented. They are all beautiful, or if not use magic to enhance their beauty. It was annoying how they are used as props (like in a James Bond movie).Except for a great mix of different mythologies and a cute pet dog, Hounded was a total miss for me. This book is obviously written with male audience in mind.

He runs a store in the college town and lives with his Irish wolf-hound, Oberon (yes, he's named after Shakespeare's fairy king). He's living a fairly quiet existence given he's been hunted by an angry god for at least 1,000 years but has been pretty safe since he decided to make his home in Arizona. Now it seems his good fortune has run out as Aengus d'Og has found him and is sending emissaries to try their hand at offing him. The story doesn't lack in imagination as the assortment of foes is creative and diverse. This is Celtic mythology at its finest with Atticus in the center of gods and goddesses behaving badly, using mortals, witches and Fae to fight their political battles. The dialogue is pithy and some of the best is between Atticus and Oberon. It's impossible to know who is telling the truth, bending it a little or just flat out lying and it makes the story delicious. After awhile, I decided to just go along for the ride, enjoying some of the best writing I've read in this genre. Atticus is so interesting and his appeal is hard to define but it's there. All of the secondary characters are very well defined, provide their own intrigue and add effectively to the tale. I was reluctant to start this book as it didn't seem to fit my interest and now I'm thrilled that it was put in front of me by friends whose opinions I trust. This is one of the best stories I've read this year and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.

One of the Tuatha Dé Danann wants it back, and is willing to throw a kitchen sink full of magical enemies Atticus's way to take possession of it. While that kitchen sink full of enemies could have seemed overwhelming, it really didn't. It's clear Hearne did a great deal of research on Celtic mythology, but he gives us just enough information on the characters he introduces to keep the narrative moving along; the pacing is quick. Some of the secondary characters here really shone. My favorites were Oberon, Atticus's faithful Irish Wolfhound, and his neighbor, the Widow MacDonagh. Any widow who pre-funcs for church and offers her backyard when a bad guy needs buryin' sounds like a good neighbor to me. A few of the humorous moments fell a little flat for me, but the humor works far more often than it doesn't. Overall, this was a great change of pace, and I recommend it for anyone who's in the mood for urban fantasy with a heavy dose of geeky humor.

You could tell he’d done a lot of reasearch on what the local flora and fauna are, and I particularly liked the way he incorporated them into the story. Let’s face it, you don’t see a lot of urban fantasies outside of big concrete-jungle cities, so it was neat to have a change of pace.The biggest draw of world-building for me was how much information he included about druidic lore and religious culture (ancient Gods and Goddesses brought to life). These elements were great, but my favorite draw was the magic. Druidic magic is interesting enough, but Hearne took it one step further by making the protagonist a master of his own unique magical development. This ranges from the charmed necklace he wears to his extensive knowledge of herbal remedies. I thought it was well done, and I always love feeling like I’ve learned something from a book.Character Development: The main character was well-rounded and frankly fun to read about. His cheeky attitude that referenced modern sayings while maintaining the dignity of one so old was a cool balance. Although there really wasn’t a lot of personal growth with Atticus, I liked his story. I think to keep enjoying him in future books, there’s going to have to be some sort of inner conflict, not just the external of people coming after him. I mentioned in my pre-review that I thought the author missed an opportunity to introduce a love interest. While I still think that’s true, I don’t mind that it didn’t happen in this first book. I’m also hoping for more in the future (I’ll talk about more in the “story” portion of the review).Most of the characters were either gods and goddesses or supernatural beings of some sort. While interesting, they weren’t exactly relatable. Because of this, I latched on to some of the more “normal” people and actually found them to be the most interesting. I’m not sure the author intended this, but if he did it worked. My favorite element was actually the wolf-hound sidekick. I thought he was a charming comic relief, and I enjoyed the scenes he was in the most. He just made things more fun, and I went with the idea that he thought more like a human than a dog (although I wasn’t sure at first if it would work).Pacing: One hit after another, this author can’t be criticized for taking things too slow. Not to say it went too fast, either. There was plenty of down time between attacks to learn more about the world and the characters. I also thought it did a good job building momentum for the climax of the book. Pacing is usually something usually talk a lot about, but with Hearne I think the best compliment I could give is that I never stopped the story to see what page I was on.Story: I like a book with more information up front. In Hounded, we know who we’re rooting for and against right away, and I thought it gave the story a great sense of direction. The concept of finally having to face something he’s been running from for hundreds of years put the reader into the action right away.I mentioned earlier that I love a book where I feel like I’ve learned something. Not life lessons, mind you, but things that I would never have the opportunity to learn in a magic-less world. Any time a character has a special skill or ability I latch on to those elements and almost always enjoy the book. I want to talk about it in this section because not only do these special skills help round out your character, they also makes for a much better story. Atticus’ apothecary, herbal knowledge, and special iron magic skills were fascinating to read about. One would’ve been interesting enough for me, but the fact that we get three leaves me a very happy reader.I’m also going to bring back up the love interest for this category. I have a hard time believing that Atticus has live for two thousand years without having experienced some sort of epic love. I sincerely hope the author addresses this in future books and maybe give solid reasoning why he’s not seeking it in this day and age. I should disclaim that I thought the book was well-rounded without this element, I just think it could’ve been even better. It was the only reason the book wasn’t a solid 5/5 stars for me.Recommendations: Overall, this was a great month in the book club world. I got to experience a great new author and see the magic in a setting not that different from where I live now. This was a great book, and I’d recommend it to those who like urban fantasies but also enjoy epic hero tales. Heck, I’d even hand this to someone looking for something “fun”.

Rovnou přiznávám, že toho nadpřirozena je tam opravdu hodně. Hned na začátku příběhu se setkáváme s druidem, elementálem, keltskou bohyní smrti a čarodějnicemi - ale to je jen slabý odvar. Kromě řady všelijakého božstva, ať už keltského, severského v čele s Thórem, či Panny Marie nebo Buddhy, se budeme pohybovat v blízkosti vlkodlaků, upírů, démonů a dalších stvoření, na něž si nedokážu vzpomenout. Nicméně nadpřirozená stvoření nejsou tím, co by vás v knize mohlo rušit.Hned od začátku na nás autor vybalil spoustu jmen, ještě ke všemu irských a pekelně krkolomných (pravé jméno Attica za boha nedokážu vyslovit!), a mluvil tak, jako by počítal s tím, že čtenář má do puntíku nastudovanou mytologii a navíc hodiny irštiny. Na začátku knihy jsem opravdu měla problém se v knize zorientovat. Jména se na stále nabalovala a navíc tam byla zmíněna jména i těch postav, které v knize vůbec nevystupují. S postupem času ale tenhle problém úplně zmizel a já si knihy užívala plnými doušky.Akce se v knize dočkáme opravdu hodně. Hned na prvních stranách se setkáme s bojem, který je pouhým odvarem toho, co nás čeká v budoucnu. Bojových scén je tam víc než dost a jsou opravdu propracované. Velkým plusem je, že autor z Attica neuděl nezničitelného superhrdinu a několikrát mu šlo o život. V těch klidnějších scénách se na druhou stranu setkáváme s vtipnými dialogy, které celou knihu odlehčí a dodají jí na čtivosti. Atticus je příjemným a sympatickým hrdinou. Je to ten typ člověka, kterého všichni znají, ale přesto nemá opravdové přátele. Atticus je vtipný, ironický, přátelský, chytrý, prohnaný a vypočítavý. A taky mocný. Atticus mi nijak k srdci nepřirostl. Ne, že by byl hrdinou špatným. Byl to spíš jen kluk od vedle, kterého vídám každý den, ale nijak ho neznám.Postavou, kterou jsem si opravdu oblíbila, byl jeho pes Oberon. Asi si říkáte, že je to zvláštní, protože je to jen pes, ale to není pravda. Atticus naučil Oberana mluvit a telepaticky se spolu mohou bavit. A právě mělkost a ztřeštěnost Oberonova charakteru mě na knize tolik bavila.Svůj imaginární klobouk musím smeknout hlavně před celým nakladatelstvím, korektory a překladatelem Romanem Tilcerem. S takhle dobrým překladem jsem se hodně dlouho nesetkala. Skoro nic mě nerušilo a četlo se to v podstatě samo. Hlavní bylo, že v textu nebyly zbytečné chyby a já narazila snad na jeden jediný překlep, a to je už co říct. Navíc je vidět, že si s tím překladatel opravdu pohrál. Nevím, jak to vypadá v originále, ale v našem překladu má každá postava určitý způsob, jakým mluví. Atticus mluví převážně spisovně, ale jiné postavy mluví různě nespisovně a určitě by bylo možné je podle přímé řeči identifikovat.Prohnaný je opravdu povedenou urban fantasy z Arizony. Zápletka je sice jasná od začátku, ale to na napínavosti neubírá. Kniha je nabytá akci, humorem a dramatičností a určitě ví, jak si udržet pozornost. Postavy jsou rozmanité a každá úplně jiná se svými vlastními úmysly. Atticus je příjemným hrdinou, který mi ani v nejmenším nevadil a mně nezbývá než čekat na další díly, abych jeho osudy mohla dál sledovat.Mrzí mě jen to, že jsem nedostala odpověď na jednu moc zajímavou otázku: Potkal se Atticus s Asterixem a Obelixem? :DTuhle knihu rozhodně doporučuju!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.513752"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.513752"]]

I've started to suspect that my dislike for that book might lie more with me than the actual writing, because I've since read another well received novel and had very similar problems with it.I'm talking about Kevin Hearne's Hounded. I saw positive reviews for it all about the place, with liberal usage of words like \"clever,\" \"funny\" and \"intelligent.\" But while I actually finished this one, I can't say that I particular enjoyed it. My biggest issue, as it was with Conqueror's Shadow, is that the author created a heavy back story for his protagonist, but it doesn't seem to weigh on the character at all.The hero of Hounded is Atticus O'Sullivan, an Irish Druid who's trying to lay low with his stolen sword in Arizona. He's also two thousand years old. Dude is older than Christ, not that you would ever suspect it. And not just because he's eternally 21 in appearance, but because his 2000 years of living haven't seemed to really effect him. I would think that living for a couple of centuries would make a guy question the point to life, make him wonder what comes next, that sort of thing. At one point he offhandly mentions that he fathered a son a few hundred years back, but it's not brought up again. Surely watching your own offspring grow old and die would mess a guy up a little? I'm not saying I wanted him to be as angst filled and existentially crises-ed as Anne Rice's vampires, but I would have liked to see him be a little darker as a result of his extended life span.But not so. Early in the book he bargain's to extend his lie even further, and no real motiation is given for this. Now, if you were dealing with a character facing a human life span you'd probably get away with that, the motivation would be obvious. But Atticus has already lived for 2000 years, honestly I would expect a little more. Is he that terrified of dying? Does he have unfinished business on the mortal plane? Nope, he's just wants to keep on living. Or something. The decision is literally given zero explanation, as though the reasons should be totally obvious.It all seemed just a little too shallow and light to me. I couldn't really believe that a 2000 year old druid would be as happy as Atticus. The guy runs an occult book store and sells teas with names that are really, really, terrible puns. He's been doing this for a while, and doesn't seem at all bored with it. Admittedly, we do get little hints of a less breezy side of him. He's extremely paranoid for example, but his paranoia seems only to benefit him and certainty we don't see it having any negative effect on his life or relationships which realistically it would. There's also one moment where we briefly mentions that if came down to living or dying he would easily abandon his friends and his beloved wolf hound to die. Now that fascinated me, and was exactly the kind of darkness I would have expected to see more of. It's obvious that Atticus places living above all else, I just wish we got some hint as to why. Maybe in future books?But as I said as the start of this review, I'm fairly sure the problem here lies with me. Most people seemed to really enjoy this book, and it is an easy read. It sets out to be a light and entertaining read, and it hits that mark perfectly. It's me that wanted it to be something else.

I know what people SAY the differences are. The thing is, I don't quite believe them. I think these genres share more common ground than differences. I see where a lot of people say \"paranormal romance\" rather than just \"paranormal.\" But a lot of my favorite books toe the line (Hex Hall and Hold Me Closer, Necromancer for example).Whatever genre you want to call those two books (they're popularly shelved as both on goodreads) that's also where Hounded by Kevin Hearne belongs. If you know my reading habits at all, you can already guess that I loved this book. You don't get a Hex Hall reference lightly in Cassi-land.It's got humor, spunk and a sexy-as-hell 2,100 year old Druid named Atticus as a main character. It's everything that I like about Hex Hall and Necromancer, but a little more grown up. Atticus has the wisdom of a man who's lived a long life with a modern sense of humor. The book has a good mix pop culture blended with history and archaic phrasing that befits an ancient druid making his way in the modern world.Hounded has one of the most interesting blends of mythology I've ever seen. It's a mish-mash of EVERYTHING. Normally that's not done. Authors pick a mythology and stick with it. But why not? This book is not trying to be a brilliant treatise on how to live life. It's FUN and a little bit frothy, but well done. I'm getting tired of books that take themselves too seriously. Lately it seems like authors have been hearing my complaints (Okay I know that's not how it works! I don't have illusions of grandeur) and there's a new class of books that are a little bit urban fantasy, a little bit paranormal and a whole lot of fun.Want a taste of the excellent voice in this novel? And it's irreverence amp; use of all religions?Mary will appear more often, though, and she can do some pretty awesome stuff if she feels like it. Mostly she sits around looking beatific and full of grace. Keeps calling me 'child,' even though I'm older than she is.\" Aside from having a kick-ass Druid as the main character, he has one of the best sidekicks ever. I'm a sucker for a talking pet. Oberon, his pet wolfhound, is pure comedy. Oberon and Atticus have a mental connection that allows for some pretty hilarious commentary. Atticus's devotion to his dog might be his most swoonworthy trait. Then again I am a dog person.lt; She's kind of like a Mary Poppins just before she turns to the dark side gt; Oberon said. He was still behind the counter, but he had a good look at her as she exited. lt; Let go of your anger, Malina! There's still good in you! The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully! gt;There is no romance in this book. I know, right? That's also not normally done, especially not with a main character as sexy as Atticus (did I mention he's posing as a 21 year old Irish man?). But it's a nice change. I expect they'll be some romance as the series advances but it was nice to have a book with no romantic entanglements and no love triangles.This book is different in a good way. It's gender-neutral, with sword fighting, magic, almost every paranormal creature imaginable and did I mention the AMAZING dog?"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.519546"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.519546"]]

Is Hounded a perfect book? No. But it’s fairly original, clever, and at times quite witty.The primary magic system in this Urban Fantasy (UF) is not the usual fare: protagonist Atticus O’Sullivan is an iron druid, drawing power from both the earth and pieces of iron. His foremost adversary is the Celtic god of love, who’s kind of an asshole. Depending on your perspective, this is either ironic or very fitting. I’m guessing Hearne was aiming for ironic.In fact, every god from every pantheon is a real deity in Hounded, and they wreak just as much havoc in its universe as they do in classic mythology. Atticus mostly interacts with Celtic gods and goddesses, many of whom hold a serious grudge against our wily druid. I thought it was very realistic that these figures were so duplicitous, and I especially liked that despite their godly status, they were not infallible. That said, Atticus defeats a certain god with a little too much ease, if you ask me. It’s not exactly a fair fight when you’re wielding an unbeatable magic sword.Atticus was so clever and he won so often that he occasionally came off as a bit of a Gary Stu (see what I did there?). And what was with all the women in this book trying to sleep with him? These women are powerful witches and goddesses, for crying out loud! They were well-matched with Atticus, I suppose. That guy sure has a healthy sexual appetite. This lady could make my head explode with magic? Damn, she’s sexy! This woman’s a death goddess? Oh goody, she’s humping my leg!The female characters in Hounded weren’t the only ones doing a little bit of leg humping: Atticus’ Irish wolf hound Oberon provides hilarious commentary and comedic relief throughout the novel, particularly his infatuation with French poodles. Oberon and Atticus have a psychic connection that allows them to communicate. They strategize, banter, and discuss the historical figures that Atticus has encountered in his 2,100 years of living. The cheer and good humour that Oberon brings to this debut are best illustrated by his tendency to imitate these historical figures, especially Ghengis Khan. There were a few moments when I literally laughed out loud at something Oberon said or did; I thought he stole the show. I’m a sucker for strong relationships between human and animal characters, and the friendship between Atticus and Oberon was beautiful.Despite the reservations I had about Atticus’ being too slick and female characters being too sexualized, I still found myself really enjoying Hounded. With Atticus' buddy Granuaile, Hearne is clearly working to establish a strong, smart, independent (and of course, hot) female character, so I have hope for future instalments. It is worth noting that Atticus is still pretty quick to objectify her though...I’ll be reading the sequel at some point so it'll be interesting to see whether the portrayal of women becomes less uncomfortable as the series progresses.

Most authors who write fantasy and novels with supernatural elements tend to tiptoe around characters that are supposed to be really old. Not many can pull it off. Human age can be divided into two categories: one – being older and having a severe allergy to stupid, and two – being young and severely stupid. This is not a knock on being young and naïve, it is a beautiful and a magical time where the world looks so endless and good because you don't know it. People would say at those times “The world is your oyster”. And it's true, but also as you get older that oyster begins to stink more and more. It's a natural process.So when you give me a guy who has seen 21 centuries my brain instantly creates a supporting image.But no.This guy has tattoos and is fluent in the meaningless and shallow one liners that are usually attributed to the witless frat boys, and he behaves in the way of a petulant child. In one sentence his mouth is full of descriptions of historical events and famous and not so famous mythical creatures and gods he has met. In the other however, he is skeptical in the magic other creatures have and use that is slightly different than his. So you expect me to believe that he has lived for 2100 years and all he has to show for it is a keg stand? Seems legit....But wait!!! It would appear that it has both more dragons and more shit!

Welcome to the world of the Iron Druid! This was not a book, this here boys and girls was a tossed salad of Greek mythology, Roman mythology, Irish folklore, Scottish folklore, and everything and anything you can think of. Every big name that had any rumored connection with anything supernatural made an appearance. It left me with a feeling that the author couldn't stick to one thing and make it work for him. I have heard that this book was bad from a friend of mine a long time ago, I should have listened. I got pulled in by a high rating. This was not an epic fantasy, this was a yard cheese sale.I can see this novel become a series on some B-rated syfy channel.

In it she describes something called the Kevin Hearne Effect, the rather magical feeling you get when one first starts Hounded, and that continues until the last page. When I started Hounded, I immediately knew exactly what she was talking about! Atticus O’Sullivan is a 1,200 year old Druid (biologically 21) who’s put down roots in Arizona and is living peacefully until a series of attacks shatter his quiet existence. You see, an ancient foe wants something Atticus has, and won’t stop until he gets it back. Hounded is told from Atticus’ point of view, and what a delightful voice! Wry, witty, and charming, Atticus is my new hero, and in Hounded, we’re lucky enough to accompany him as he and his friends plan a showdown with this powerful foe. And what friends! Kevin Hearne has created an amazing cast of supporting characters, but my favorite by far is Oberon, Atticus’ Irish Wolfhound that he can communicate with using his mind. Oberon is a sweet, scene-stealing pleasure, and (at the risk of dating myself), reminds me quite a lot of Einstein, the canine with human intelligence in Dean Koontz’s Watchers. The banter between Atticus and Oberon made me laugh out loud, and Oberon is almost as big of a presence as Atticus! Add to that a death Goddess named Morrigan, the huntress Flidais, a vampire and a werewolf (both Atticus’ lawyers), a elderly, feisty neighbor that helps Atticus more than once, a coven of witches who may or may not have Atticus’ best interests at heart, a sword that is the source of Atticus’ problems, and you you’ve got the recipe for one of the best books of the year! In Atticus’ world, the Gods are alive and well, and aren’t afraid to make themselves known. Norse, Christian, Indian, you name it, they all exist, and if you have a love of Celtic myth, this is the book for you. The magic system is fascinating and unique and it’s obvious the author put quite a bit of time and research into exploring the history of Druids and Druid magic. Inevitable comparisons will be made to Jim Butcher’s Dresden Files, and to me, that’s a good thing! I got to geek out a little with this one too, because there’s lots of references to Star Wars and other awesomeness! In a sea of female urban fantasy heroines, Atticus and his crew are a breath of fresh air! Fans of fantasy and urban fantasy will eat this one up, and the good news is that you won’t have to wait for books 2 and 3 to come out. Hexed and Hammered drop in June, and readers will be lining up to get their hands on them! Hounded is a series debut that is absolutely not to be missed!

Atticus has been successfully lying low in Arizona, but now his enemies have finally found him. This time though Atticus is not eager to move on and decides to make his stand. He has both allies and enemies among the gods of his Irish birthplace - all of them having agendas, both hidden and not - and a team of kick-butt supernatural lawyers to smooth things for him in the mortal world. But even still, the upcoming battle is one he may not survive. I really enjoyed Hounded, but the story is more talk than action to start out while author Kevin Hearne does all of the setup for Atticus, his relationships with Morrigan, the goddess of Battle, and Flidais, the goddess of the hunt, and the explanation of how Atticus came to possess a magical sword sought after by another of the Irish gods. Not too worry, once all the exposition is out of the way there is plenty of action to be had. The protagonist Atticus Sullivan is compared to Harry Dresden in the marketing materials for Hounded, but is probably a bit wilier - though he hides it - and doesn't have Harry's sense of chivalry. So while Atticus is still basically a decent guy who mows his elderly neighbors lawn, he has a strong sense of self preservation which allows his morals to be a bit more flexible, but I still found Atticus likable and think that Harry's fans will like Atticus too. Even with all the other lofty personages in the story, one of my favorite characters though was Atticus' wolfhound companion Oberon, who speaks to Atticus mentally and Oberon's doggy-eye view of the world is pretty humorous even to those of us who are not hugely pet-centric. I also got a real kick out of Atticus' highly paid lawyers, werewolf Hal and vampire Leif, who manage the fallout in the human world even as Atticus' enemies' minions are throwing mundane legal obstacles in Atticus' way. I was lucky enough to get this as an ARC for free through Amazon's Vine and I am glad I had a chance to read Hounded and I will definitely be adding this series to my must buy list. I loved all of the mythological characters that Hearne mentioned and the ones he wove into the Hounded and I am excited, because it looks like while Hearne focused on the Irish gods here, Atticus will be taking on the Norse ones in the next book.

Not so with Atticus!Admittedly my other reason was I was eager to see how all the pantheons of deities interacted and most especially the Celtic lore.  I was happily ready to read, spot a deity I only cursorily know, look them up and then go back.  Hearne didn't make me need those encyclopedias though, he gives a very good accounting of these deities without having Atticus run around playing Exposition Man.   In truth I appreciated the fact that Atticus was neither too modern nor too archaic in his speech and mannerisms.  He balanced the line well; he managed to adapt many of the customs he grew up with to modern day and picked up the speech patterns of the modern world well.  He was practical where others expected him to be foolish (given his words) or reckless (given his actions).  It never got tiring to see when it dawned on people that hey Atticus is a clever one.On occasion descriptions got to be a bit tedious or redundant--Hearne doesn't need to tell us, every single time, what's going on with Atticus' tattoos.  Or that he has to be barefoot to channel his power.  I understood--Atticus is on land, thus he's barefoot'ed, thus he's very powerful.  I did find the descriptions of his charms, as well as the fact that he bound Iron to his aura, to be fascinating.  It took him centuries, of a magical practice of his own devising, which makes me wonder how some of the trial and error steps went.Other than Atticus I had a definite love for Morrigan--so sly and blunt and arrogant.  Oberon, Atticus' faithful irish deerhound companion was a hoot.  At one point he wants to be just like Ghengis Khan and demands a horde of french poodles.Hounded was a joyride.  The fight scenes were thrilling, Atticus was a charmer and lest I forget all the mythology...its like mythologist dream come true.  The acknowledgment of the various Pantheons have for each other, but also the snide comments they have, had me grinning."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.548761"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.548761"]]

Then it won for Book of the Month in one of my groups, so I decided to put my reservations aside and give it a go.On the good front - the Celtic mythology stuff was very well researched and used. It wasn't horribly cringe-worthy as I've seen in some other books - like the Nicholas Flamel ones. Also, I thought some of the general historical stuff - like Druids having to study for tons of years just to memorize things, them being keepers of lore and law, amongst other things, and a lot of that was good, too.Also, I enjoyed Oberon, the dog, and the connection that Atticus has with him in the sense that some of the one-liners were pretty funny. Aside from that, though, while I do like \"talking animals\" in books, to an extent, I prefer their thought patterns to seem more animal. Oberon just seemed far too sophisticated and too human in thought process. I know they pay mention to the fact that Atticus had to teach him to talk in words and not just feelings and images like most animals - but it would've been more realistic, as far as realism can go with such things, if his thought process still seemed more doggy.In other words, anthropomorphism fail.As for Atticus himself - I never really gelled with him. He seemed far too much of a cool, modern every man kind of guy. For someone who's meant to be 2100 years old, he was just way too hip. There's some lip-service given to him being adaptable and whatnot, but there are never times when he seems more than the persona he portrays.Except, that is, for his nigh invincibility, and, really, it's kind of boring to read about a character who is so over-powered that even the gods are impressed with his magic. I never felt like he was in any real peril, and I don't think I would've cared all that much if he was.(I know some women find him oh-so-dreamy and sexy, but he's just not my kind of sexy. *shrugs*)Oh, and the action sequences, in general, were pretty meh.Overall, it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't all that great, either. I've heard that the second in the series gets much better and works out some of these kinks. I might be willing to give it a shot at some future point, but it's pretty low on my priority list."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.551686"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.551686"]]

And that’s where Atticus O’Sullivan, rare book salesman, herb peddler, and 2,000 year old Druid the last of his kind has decided to set up shop. He’s been on the run, guarding a very powerful sword from a very angry ancient Celtic god for over two millennia now. But while these years have been good to him Atticus has become more powerful than he could have possibly imagined The Morrigan, a very old god of death, has predicted death and doom for our hero, and it’s up to Atticus, with help from a pride of werewolves, and a gorgeous bartender possessed by an Indian witch, to stay alive, hopefully for another thousand yearsI read this book in literally a day it was so good. the characters are so rich and they just draw you in and make you want to know more of the story. I mean with quotes like this:\"What sealed the deal for me was that the cloak wouldn't come off without a generous donation of my tears. Those used to be almost impossible for me to summon, I admit, until I watched Field of Dreams. When Kevin Costner asks his dad at the end if he'd like to have a catch, I just completely lose my shit.\" who wouldn't want to read more. It is one of the best Urban Fantasy books I've read in a long time and the thing I like the most about it is that it's not just another book where you read about a kick ass chick with leather and swords. It's actually got a dude for the main character and he kicks just as much ass, and he's funny to boot. What I loved about this book is that even though there was piles of action I NEVER stopped laughing. That for me is a sign that I'm reading one hell of a good book.If you're looking for something different and you want a good laugh and a good story then pick up Hounded. It's an amazing read and I hope that you love it as much as I did.

Imagine that, with a sprinkling of my Greek and Roman classics classes, a dash of my Religion and Ritual in India anthropology course, a liberal dose of my many years of bible studies, Christian and Catholic upbringings and education, and the first year Religion course in Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Add on top of that a hot, Irish druid, a \"talking\" Irish wolfhound, a slightly sarcastic tone, and an inability to take itself seriously.See. Catnip.The book introduces us to Atticus O'Sullivan. He is a 2100 year old druid who is living in Phoenix, Arizona. He runs an occult bookshop and cafe, and likes fish and chips at the Irish pub down the road. He's hanging out there because after running around the world for many centuries, he's settled in the furthest place he can find from the Irish god he annoyed several centuries ago. But as all these things go, that doesn't last for long.The book cannot be taken seriously. I've read complaints from people saying it was silly and they were disappointed at that fact. Why on earth would you get grumpy at that? I can understand picking up a book about a druid who's lived for millennia and is hiding out in America, interacting with gods and goddesses and faey and witches and anything else that comes through his door, and thinking it was a serious piece of literature (actually, I can't in case you missed the sarcasm). But if you did, I am pretty sure you would notice early and could adjust your expectations to enjoy it.It's fluff. It is incredibly enjoyable, laugh out loud funny, fluff. The mythology I know is pretty well researched though. Even the Slavic stuff (Zoryas this time, unfortunately no Rusalka). So you know, you could learn something in it as well. But if people want to waste their time getting grumpy, then far be it from me to stop them. However. I think you should read it and I think you should enjoy it for being silly.

Atticus runs a bookstore/new age shop. But is really a druid in hiding. The people around him too are special and by “people” I mean gods, goddesses, witches, werewolves, and throw in vampire as well. On one hand Atticus is trying to keep a low profile, but on the other, he is being hunted by a certain someone. This someone has cops, witches and demons to do his bidding. HILARIOUS: Here, our druid can talk with dogs. What’s better is the dog he spoke to is absolutely endearing in this one. Sure, Oberon doesn’t go “Pooh, Todd! Pooh!” like Manchee, but he is just as cute, maybe even more so. That dog’s fixation on sausages and poodles just got me laughing. (Except if you’re listening to him on audio instead of reading through it, as I first was at first, well he sounded like a lackey from one of those mob movies.) Atticus on the other hand is positively hilarious! But when it came down to doing what had to be done he did not pull any punches. Think of Darynda Jones’s Charlie only smoother and not as heavy with the humor. ACTION PACKED:  If anything bad could happen, it normally did happen... to him or with him around. So, he went into one scrape after another. AND BROUGHT IT. I think it’s this aspect that made things go really well for me. Where blood was to be shed, Atticus blinked, but later acted. So he wasn’t all bloodthirsty let me at 'em kick ass; he was “go with flow” till something ticked him off. Yet nothing felt overdone. It’s fast paced, and there was a reason for everything that took place. By its end each thing, each persons role, the reason behind each thing that happened was made obvious.Oh, Who am I kidding? I’m all about Oberon!

Their (mental) banter is fun, Oberon's doggy affection is warm, and the action keeps the book moving quickly. There are a lot of supernatural players in this series, from gods and witches to werewolves and vampires. It can be a bit of a trick to keep the identities and allegiances straight, but not to where I felt burdened by it. There is not as much as I prefer of emotional depth in this story - Atticus is cool and collected, and although a beautiful (or spell-casting or powerful) woman can occasionally knock him off balance with desire, he shows no deep affection for anyone but his dog. He heals so well that physical damage is an annoyance, not a source of angst. While this is totally understandable in someone near-immortal who has outlived everyone he might have cared about, it makes him more interesting than empathic. Luckily his dog is there to make him more relatable. (Oberon's understanding of the world is sometimes unevenly portrayed - on occasion he's given a witty quip to say that doesn't fit his wolfhound brain and previous ignorance - but he's still a good dog :) )I may continue with this series at some point, possibly even right away, because not losing track of all the players before reading the next book might be the best plan.

The cover makes this look like a paranormal romance. It’s not. It’s a humorous urban-fantasy adventure.

He’s developed awesome powers over the centuries, but maintains the appearances of a handsome 22-year-old, and keeps up with his pop culture, in order to blend in. Lately, he’s been living quietly in Arizona, running a New Age book-and-herbal shop (used by the author as an excuse for a couple of outdated and unnecessary complaints about marijuana users, oh well). However, the Tuatha Dé Danann have tracked him down, and soon Atticus (and his faithful dog, Oberon) will find himself facing his ancient enemy, Aengus Óg. A variety of figures from the Celtic pantheon turn up, as well as assorted vampires, werewolves, witches, demons, giants, and what have you. Bear in mind, the whole convoluted scenario is tongue-in-cheek – if you’re looking for high drama, look elsewhere. But I found the book to be fun, light reading.

I know it's disrespectful to both authors, but you know what? It's my review. I'm giving Kevin Hearne four shiny stars if he has words for me, he's more than welcome to share them.Atticus O'Sullivan, owner of Third Eye Occult Books and Herbs the Arizona desert, is just your average guy. More or less.There are many perks to living for twenty-one centuries, the foremost among them is bearing witness to the rare birth of genius.Except, you know. He's a Druid.Atticus has been living in relative peace with his wolfhound, Oberon, and had nothing to serious to worry about for a good few years.When he's attacked by thugs who, most likely, work for God Of Love Aeanghus Og, who wants Atticus dead due to his possession of Fragarach, the Answerer, he doesn't think much of it, just wastes them.But then the Morrigan, Goddess of Death, whom he has a friendly, if, slightly morbid, agreement with to never take his life herself, warns him that a warrior will die soon, and die very surprised.If Aeanghus Og and Atticus were to come to blows, one of them would surely die. And it's not set it stone it would be the God of Love (starting to wonder how he got that name...).As a firm believer of 'storm clouds are thrice cursed', Atticus isn't surprised when the whole world seems to turn against him at once, and not one, not two, but three goddesses (one of whom gets his dog to murder someone with her godly control over living creatures) tell him to run to the hills. One of them does want him to stay and fight, but she does not expect him to live.After allying himself with half of the local witch coven, your friendly neighborhood wolf pack, an Indian witch living inside a pretty redheaded bartender's brain, and, completely off the books, two goddesses of the Tuatha De Danann, Atticus sets out to fight his final fight against Aeanghus Og.After running from Aeanghus for hundreds of years, he's not running any further.So, gather up all your friends and go dashing into what could possibly be heroic suicide?Mingled shouts of \"Hell's bells!\" and \"Gods below!\" are sorta getting mixed up in my head, but, you all know what i'm trying to say.Jim Butcher wrote what was quite possibly the first 'urban fantasy' book that was widely known, so i'm not surprised people are still writing books like that. They're fun to read, you know? Who doesn't like that?Maybe a young wizard is a little more my speed than an old Druid, (though he has done something to himself so that he only looks around twenty-one, which would make him physically younger than Harry Dresden) but I really enjoyed Hounded. I was familiar with the genre, but the characters and the story was all-new, and I got to experience a type of lore I hadn't before; Druids.Earth magic is an old religion (of sorts) and I thought a modern spin on it told by someone the reader can get a few laughs out of was a great idea. The story is engrossing and the characters are great, but you know what won it for me?Oberon.Stuff like this:lt; Wait. gt;What's wrong?lt; Is that tiny little toy car Hal's? gt;It's a very expensive toy. You're supposed to be careful with the leather seats.lt; So i'm supposed to ninja past these cops, tread across the broken glass, -you remember the broken glass, right?-avoid the buckets 'o blood outside the door, and silently jump into that tiny little car without saying hello to the upholstery? gt;An excellent summation. Make it quick..lt; Not so fast. Promise you'll get me a date with a French poodle? gt;Seriously? You're holding out on me right now? I've been shot and i'm coughing up blood and you're negotiating for some tail?lt; Oh, all right. But I totally deserve one and you know it. I've been a good widdle doggie. gt;Seriously, having a big furry dog you can talk to in your head? That's been a dream of mine since I was like three!I love Mister, Harry Dresden's cat, but i'm a diagnosed dog person.All in all, Hounded is a seriously great urban fantasy book with tons of awesome lore and a lot a great characters.And hey? If you've read The Dresden Files, you'll be able to understand all this fea and knight stuff a lot easier. It sure came in handy for me, having read some of it before.Finishing The Dresden Files and The Raven Cycle are top-priority for me right now, but before too long i'll be back in the world of The Iron Druid Chronicles."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.613571"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.613571"]]

Beni çeken yönü genellikle karakterler kendi yollarını çizmişdir ve -elbette kitap boyunca bu kişiler olgunlaşıyor ama başlangıçta zaten yarı yolunda giden hayatları, gerekli bağlantıları vardır- kendi güçleri vardır. Onları kovalayan problemlere bir çare düşünebilmektedirler. Bu benim için büyük bir artı çünkü zengin karakterleri çok seviyorum.Hounded'da işte böyle bir karakter vardı. Normalde Urban Fantasy'de kadın karakter okumaya alışkınım, ama bu sefer çok şaşırmıştım, çünkü kitabın kahramanı Atticus hem bir Druid hem de erkek. Üstelik çok iyi bağlantıları var. 2100 yaşında. Ufak bir dükkanda bitki ve büyü ile ilgili şeyler satarak hayatını kazanıyor. Ama her şey Morrigan adlı bir tanrıçanın eski düşmanı olan bir tanrının değerli kılıcı için onu öldüreceğini kehanet etmesi ile başlıyor. Bir tanrıça gidiyor, diğeri geliyor, arada bunu öpüyorlar vs.Kitabın başı biraz sıkıcıydı ama ortalarda hikaye oturmaya başlıyor ve yabancı isimler (İrlanda) tanıdık gelmeye başlıyor.Druid deyince rahip gibi bir şey beklemeyin. Yani böyle:Atticus doğadan güç çekebiliyor, bilgisi bu konuda çok iyi ama o daha çok bir savaşçı. Üstelik Tanrıçaların ilgisine bakılırsada çok ilgi çekici bir erkek. Druidler doğadan güç alabiliyorlar, Atticus da bu yüzden sürekli doğa ile iç içe. Sürekli bir ağaç, bitki vs geçiyor. Yaşının getirdiği kurnazlığı, paranoidliği ve bağlantıları var. Kurtadamlar, vampirler, cadılar, tanrılar...Bu da bize tarif edilen görüntüsü, ben pek yadırgamadım.Kolundaki dövme doğadan güç çekebilmesi için gerekli. Ayrıca boynunda 750 yıl boyunca uğraşıp yaptığı etkili bir kolyesi | tılsımı var. Ayrıca 4 tane farklı şekle girebiliyorNeyse kitaba döneyim. Eski düşmanı Atticus'tan kılıcı almaya (eskiden ona aitmiş ama savaş sırasında Atticus'un olmuş) geliyor. Bunun için gerek tanrılar ile gerek yerel cadılarla iş yapıyor. Atticus'ın peşine polis takıyor. Dediğim gibi Atticus'un çok iyi bağlantıları, kendi gücü, yetenekleri var. Bu saldırıların hepsini bir şekilde savuşturuyor. Kitabın sonunda ise büyük bir savaş var. Kötü adam (ismi telafuz edilemeyecek kadar garip) cadılarla ve tanrılarla iş birliği yapıyor, cehennemin kapısını açıp iblisleri getiriyor ve Atticus'un köpeği Oberon (konuşabilen büyülü bir köpek) ve Avukatı (kurtadam) Hal'ı kaçırıyor. İşte bu aşamada Atticus 2100 yıl önce yapması gereken şeyi yapıyor ve kaçmak yerine kötü adamla dövüşüyor. Onu öldürüyor ve kapısını açtığı cehenneme Ölüm ile beraber gönderiyor. Kitabın sonunda Atticus'un bir çırağı ve halletmesi gereken yeni problemleri oluyor.Kitap benim \"ah çok heyecanla okudum, bittim öldüm\" listeme asla giremez. En azından bu ilk kitapla, çünkü Atticus'a biraz fazla yüklenilmişti ve sürekli bir yerden bir tanrı fırtlayıp ona yardım ediyordu. Onun çaresizliğini hissedemiyorduk. Ayrıca kitapta AŞK yok. Ben urban fantasy'lerimi azıcık aşka bulanmış severim. Bu kitapta ise bir gram yok. Buda benim için büyük bir eksi.Güzel yönleri ise karakterin bağlantıları, gücü, kurnazlığı...ve Oberon. Oberon çok renk katan bir öğeydi. Atticus ile zihinsel bir bağlantıları var ve konuşabiliyorlar. Sırf bununla da kalmıyor, çünkü Oberon'un düşünce tarzı komik. Ayrıca sosisleri ve fransız poodle'larına karşı zahafı beni kahkahalara sürükleri. Paranormal olmasa da kitapda dul, yaşlı bir bayan var. Gerek konuşma tarzı gerek Atticus ile şakalaşmaları beni gerçekten eğlendirdi.Yazarın dil, kitabın kurgusu ise gayet güzel. olayların temelsiz geliştiğini düşünmüyorsunuz ya da bu buraya nereden geldi diye... Tek sorun sürekli bir problemin ani bir tanrı-cadı yardımı ile hallolması. Kıssadan hisse bu kitap kesinlikle okunabilir, okunmalı. Aşk hikayelerini sevmeyenlere önerilir. Erkek bir yazar yazmış bunuda göz önünde bulundurmalı, zira kadınların eğiliminde olduğu duygusal sahneler yok.İkinci kitabı okumayı düşünüyorum, seriye devam edermiyim işte bu konuda belirleyici rol oynayacak.Ufak bir alıntı:\"I wanted one of those fabulous anime moments where the hero sticks the sword into the bad guy’s guts and everything quivers, even the sweat droplets, and the bad guy vomits blood and says something in a tiny surprised voice, like, “That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword,” right before he dies.

After reading and loving Ben Aaronovitch's The Folly series, when I heard about The Iron Druid Chronicles, I had to read Hounded. It's a completely different form of urban fantasy – where The Folly is a magical police procedural, The Iron Druid Chronicles is what seems to be the more classical supernatural kind of urban fantasy – it is just as good.Hounded is told in a first-person narrative. The success of this sort of story depends on the strength of its narrator and protagonist. Luckily Atticus is a great one; he's a fun mix of old soul and modern kid by choice, trying hard to blend in by learning the vagaries of modern language and technology. I would have loved to have learned more of his history and what he's seen in his long life, but that might be the historical fiction fan in me coming to the surface. In Hounded we only get tantalizing glimpses and hints, hopefully they'll be explored in future books. The same goes for some background history on the werepack and Leif. I thought the idea of Viking werewolves and a Viking vampire is very cool, especially them teaming up to start a law firm. And their payment plan is quite interesting as well!Women are Atticus' kryptonite. Let's say our favourite druid has a very healthy libido, perhaps fitting for his seeming age of twenty-one, and it leads him into all kinds of trouble. On the one hand, I found this amusing, as you'd think that after twenty-one centuries, he'd have learned to deal with this by now. On the other hand, it was rather annoying to have him be distracted by every bit of skirt walking by! However, the irritation was smoothed away as we learn how there are several goddesses who happily exploit this weakness to manipulate him into doing what they want. You can't help but groan every time Atticus let's himself be led astray by his baser urges and misses some pertinent facts during these exchanges, not just with the goddesses, but with mortal women as well.Oberon, Atticus' hound, was fantastic! A hound who quotes Star Wars, what can be better than that? I like that Oberon's voice is still quite doggy and not some all-wise familiar's, where it is even hard to discern you're still dealing with an animal companion. For example, when he sees Atticus coming home, he goes all mad with happiness as dogs are wont to do. He has some of the funniest lines in the book and his desire to be the canine version of Genghis Khan, including a harem of French poodles, is classic. I adore Oberon and I can't wait to read more of him.The plot centring around Atticus' conflict with Aenghus Óg about the sword Fragarach is quite interesting too. While it could have been rather straightforward, it is anything but, and it's the intricacies that make it engaging. At the heart of these intricacies are the Tuatha De Danann and their manipulations. I roundly fell for some of their schemes right along with Atticus. Add to this a coven of witches, who Atticus isn't sure he can trust, a disgruntled across-the-street neighbour, the lovely Mrs. MacDonagh from up the street and a witch-possessed bartender wishing to become his apprentice, and you can see how Atticus might be feeling a little overwhelmed by it all. However, with the help of both Oberon, and his friendly Viking laywers, Atticus manages to keep his head afloat and manages to come through this conflict, if not unscathed, at least alive. Hounded was so much fun, I raced through it. It'll be interesting to see where Hearne will take his characters next in Hexed. Once the book-buying ban is lifted I'm definitely getting Hexed and Hammered! Good news for Hearne (and the reader) is that Orbit has snapped up the UK right to the first three books and even better news is that Del Rey has signed Hearne to deliver three more books in the Iron Druid Chronicles. So it looks like there will be plenty more Atticus and Oberon to enjoy in the future. If you're a fan of urban fantasy, of the different mythologies out there or just looking for a fun read, Hounded is definitely a book to pick and give a try."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.651015"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.651015"]]

I was expecting the reader-screwing cliffhanger plot device but no. I love you for that alone Mr. Hearne.I knew it was a winner when about halfway through, I did not try to work anything out in my own mind. I completely trusted Kevin Hearne's judgment and vision. I can tell you that I have not adored the work of a male author of this genre in a very long time. Not intentionally or with prejudice but I don’t care for dungeons and dragons overkill. As a result, I found it difficult, at best, to find anyone who could do anything close to what Jim Butcher and Simon Green accomplish with Harry Dresden Summer Knight and John Taylor Something from the Nightside. Although Urban Fantasy is such a broad genre with so many creative directions and paranormal possibilities, I did not see a Druid coming as the hero against other stronger magical beings. The main character of Hounded is Atticus and he is a Druid. On a power scale or magical food chain, Druids are not as kickass as warlocks, wizards, or sorcerers not to mention vamps, weres, and demons. So I never saw Atticus coming or the magical potential he would have at his disposal. He is smart and resourceful which has resulted in him staying alive for more than 2000 years against all kinds of odds. Druids are not naturally immortal but Atticus has found his own way to not only stay alive but remain in the summer of his life (physically 21 years old). He is also the last 'known' Druid.Atticus lives in Arizona surrounded by dessert so the Fae and their unlimited minions would not have an easy time getting their hands on him with no forest close to use as a portal. He has a wolfhound name Oberon whom he can communicate with mind-to-mind. The conversations are hilarious. The book is pretty much YA so he is not sleeping around every five minutes although he is handsome and willing. Like all Druids, his magic comes from the earth but he is equally gifted with other weapons and trickery. I love the fact that this book moves quickly but I wish it could have been longer. The protagonist is an old enemy who seeks the return of his magical sword named Fragarach and to kill Atticus as a bonus. This turn of events puts Atticus in the middle of Tuatha De' Danann (faeries on steroids) court politics and at the mercy of a coven of duplicitous witches just for starters. We have an impressive list of gods and goddesses to round it all off. Atticus also deals with legal drama caused by magical influences trying to flush him out in the open. He is aided time and again by his lawyers, Hal a werewolf and Leif a vampire. The overall mythology follows the Tuatha De' Danann with a patchwork of other deadly beings. Mr. Hearne deconstructs the mythology and basically leans the magic toward sorcery. As a result, those who have sworn off this sometimes complicated mythology can follow with ease.Although I found no monumental weaknesses in this book, I did want to know more about Atticus than was revealed. I truly could have gone another 100 pages. I wasn’t crazy about Atticus being frozen at 21 years old. It leaves too big an opening for him to become stupid. I don’t see it from here but it happens. I will be so disappointed if Mr. Hearne dumbs him down. Right now, he has the confidence of John Taylor and the paranoia of Harry Dresden. Since the story is told in first person, it would make my teeth ache if the winning components that make Atticus so interesting are minimized in any way. Just a little warning Mr. Hearne – don’t change Atticus.I highly recommend you read this book if you like Urban Fantasy that is not too weighty or dark. At times this book is laugh out loud funny. If you want to have some fun with a character, introduce your brain to Atticus. My only regret is that I got this at the library and don’t own it. I will certainly buy the next one."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.655067"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.655067"]]

Wenn man solange lebt, dann ist das Zeit genug, um es sich mit einigen Leuten (oder auch Gottheiten) gehörig zu verscherzen. Atticus lebt daher versteckt mit seinem Hund in Arizona und führt einen Buchladen mit allerlei esoterischem Krimskrams. Nur in letzter Zeit klappt das mit dem Verstecken nicht mehr ganz so gut und Ärger ist im Anmarsch. Für mich war das Wort \"Druide\" schon ausschlaggebend, um meine Aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. Der einzige Druide, der mir spontan einfällt, ist sonst nämlich Mirakulix aus dem Asterix-Universum. In Fantasybüchern finden wir solche Gestalten aber eher selten. Grund genug, dass ich das natürlich lesen wollte. Und ich wurde auch nicht enttäuscht, denn \"Gehetzt\" unterhält ganz wunderbar mit viel Spannung, Action und Humor. Zugegeben, die Handlung an sich strotzt nicht vor Originalität, aber sowohl das Setting als auch die Charaktere machen das wieder wett. Der Schwerpunkt der fantastischen Elemente in diesem Buch sind der keltischen Mythologie entnommen. Neben den keltischen Gottheiten und Gestalten, haben aber auch gängigere mystische Wesen ihren Auftritt wie Werwölfe, Vampire oder Hexen. Es wird dabei aber nicht langweilig, denn der Autor verfällt nicht in Klischees und gibt jedem Wesen eine Persönlichkeit mit auf den Weg. Wie die Art der Magie, die kulturellen Einflüsse und die keltische Mythologie mit den gängigen Fantasyelementen verschmelzen, fühlte sich für mich sehr stimmig an. Diese Thematik ist mal etwas anderes und bringt Spaß beim Lesen. \"Gehetzt\" wird flüssig und locker aus der Ich-Perspektive von Atticus erzählt. Und Atticus ist ein Charakter, den ich schnell sympathisch fand. Begeistert hat mich sein Sinn für Humor, aber auch seine inneren Monologe, die manchmal sehr sarkastisch sind. Ich hätte mir nur gewünscht, dass er nicht ganz so perfekt erscheint, sondern auch die ein oder andere Sorge, Kante oder Ecke mitbringt. Obwohl er schon so lange lebt, trauert er kaum geliebten Menschen nach oder ist sonst auf eine Weise von der Zeit gezeichnet. Seine schier unerschöpfliche Machtquelle, kostet ihn kaum Kraft oder bringt sonst einen Preis für ihn mit sich. Das ist schade und hätte alles noch einmal interessanter und authentischer gemacht. Mein Highlight in diesem Buch war Oberon, der Hund und Weggefährte von Atticus. Obwohl die beiden miteinander gedanklich kommunizieren können, verliert Oberon nie seine tierische Wesensart. Diese Unterhaltungen zwischen den beiden brachten mich sehr häufig zum Lachen. Ich möchte bitte auf einen Oberon haben! Auf den letzten Seiten findet man auch noch Hilfestellung zur Aussprache der irischen Wörter. Leider habe ich das erst zum Schluss entdeckt und werde wohl auch im nächsten Band die Aussprache, wie ich sie mir gedanklich nun über 350 Seiten angewöhnt habe, beibehalten. Für alle, die es beim lesen etwas genauer mit der Aussprache nehmen möchten, die wagen gerne zuerst einen Blick auf die letzten Seiten. Zum Schluss ein kleiner Vergleich: Als Leserin von Urban Fantasy-Büchern lag natürlich auch schnell der Vergleich zu Harry Dresden nahe. Beide Charaktere sind männlich, wirken Magie und werden ständig mit anderen magischen und überirdischen Wesen konfrontiert. Genauso hatte ich auch das Gefühl, dass beide das gleiche Händchen dafür haben, in Ärger hineinzustolpern. Aber diese Gemeinsamkeiten sind dann auch schon alles, denn \"Gehetzt\" unterhält lockerer und brachte mich öfter zum Grinsen. Dazu kommt, dass Atticus einfach ein draufgängerischer Protagonist ist, der sich seiner Fähigkeiten bewusst ist und sich nicht scheut gleich mal dem Gegner eins überzubraten. Das unterscheidet ihn meiner Ansicht nach von Harry. Fazit: \"Gehetzt\" ist ein humorvolles und actiongeladenes Urban Fantasybuch, das alte Mythen wiederbelebt. Es wird auf keiner Seite langweilig, denn Atticus und sein Hund sind sympathische Charaktere. Für alle Fantasy-Leser und Harry Dresden-Fans empfehlenswert!

Then I saw how much Carmel (Rabid Reads) was enjoying The Iron Druid Chronicles on audio I knew I had to give it a try. The Characters:Oberon! Sometimes there’s a secondary character that steals the show and Atticus’s Irish wolfhound, Oberon is the one for Hounded (and I’m sure for the whole series).Atticus is a druid and he has a magical connection with Oberon that allows them to talk to each other telepathically and their conversations are so funny it had me snorting while listening to them.Don’t get me wrong it’s not all about Oberon (even if he is the best sidekick I’ve read in a long time). Atticus is a 2,1000 year old druid that looks like a college student. He runs a bookstore where you can get special teas. He knows how to swing a sword and he’s very good at using magic. I love that he can change shapes into different animals when the need calls for it. I’m sure that will make for interesting times in the future.The Narration:As much as I enjoyed Hounded, I’m not sure if I would have enjoyed as much if I had read it. Luke Daniels does an amazing job with bringing Atticus and especially Oberon to life. Truly, I could picture a dog every time Daniels spoke his lines. Some had me thinking “Which way did he go George?” and “I’ll pet him and squeeze him.” (If you grew up watching Bugs Bunny then you know what I’m talking about. LOL)Luke Daniels also did the female voices very well and that’s one thing I look at when listening to a male narrator.The Writing:Kevin Hearne has created a complex world with entertaining characters that sucked me into the story within a matter of a few chapters. Hearne peppers his world with pop culture references like Oberon quoting South Park,”You will respect my authoritah.” And nods to Star Wars.Favorite Quote/Scene:“You don’t even know if she really likes you,” Oberon said as we exited and I unlocked my bike.“She could be doing her customer service routine and stringing you along in hopes of a big tip the next time you come in. With dogs you just go up and smell their asses and you know where you stand, it’s so much easier. Why can’t humans do that?”Will I continue the series?YES! I have the rest of the series on audio from different sales and gifted credits. I’m ready to binge on more Atticus and Oberon. I highly recommend Hounded to any Urban Fantasy fan. And to the audio junkies you should try it on audio, you won’t be sorry.Similar book/series:The Asylum Tales by Jocelynn Drake\n  "], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.662874"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.662874"]]

La acción ocurre en unas cuantas páginas más adelante y mientras esta se desarrolla el autor hace uso de ella para casi terminar de explicarnos algunas cosas; digo casi terminar porque es durante todo el libro que vamos conociendo más a fondo a Atticus, que sin duda me ha parecido un personaje increíble.En sí, cada uno de los personajes que lo acompañan me han resultado estupendos y es que el autor ha sabido sacarles el mayor provecho a cada uno de ellos.Cabe destacar que Atticus tiene una mascota, un perro lebrel irlandés y este también forma parte de ese vario pinto grupo de personajes que te hacen disfrutar la historia con sus diálogos ingeniosos y divertidos, sin duda un personaje que llegas amar.En cuanto a la trama debo de admitir que pensé que se desarrollaría de cierta manera pero conforme se van dando los acontecimientos toma un camino diferente, lo que da pie a que otros personajes tomen papeles importantes, lo cual me resulto reconfortante porque el autor te mantiene a la expectativa de lo que pasará a continuación y que sin duda aprovecha para tomar giros inesperados en la historia.Nunca había leído algo acerca de la cultura celta y los druidas, lo que en sí resulta el punto fuerte y novedoso de la historia, todo esto contado en la época actual otorgándole mayor atractivo.Sin duda es uno de los mejores libros que he leído este año, esta lleno de ingenio, diálogos divertidos, personajes grandiosos, acción, cosas inesperadas, una historia que no quieres que termine y que cuando piensas que ya no te va a poder sorprender más a la vuelta de la página de das cuenta de que verdaderamente el ingenio no se le acaba a Kevin Hearne.Sin temor a equivocarme me declaro una fiel seguidora de sus libros, puesto que si éste me encanto enormemente sin duda los siguientes también lo harán.Lo recomiendo ampliamente."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.666852"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.666852"]]

So, I'm putting it on my \"couldn't finish\" bookshelf and MAY come back to it another time when I'm desperate for a listen. I am doing a review, even though I have not finished the book, because it seems like nearly every other review I have read (Goodreads, Audible, Amazon) has mostly glowing praise of how wonderful and humorous this book is. I feel those reviews have led me to waste money, not only on this first book of the Iron Druid Chronicles, but also on the next two. I wish I could get a refund from Audible on all three of them. I have not found the story to be very humorous. I have no empathy for the main character and did not find him to be admirable.I like fantasy books. I have enjoyed ones that also include references to mythology or historical connections. The idea of a long-lived druid in a modern urban settings seemed like an interesting possibility. I'll grant that this book starts off pursuing that possibility in a fairly reasonable way.However, there were four things that nagged at me enough as I began listening to make me give up on the book. One reason is because very often the thing I don't like about first-person told stories is that the \"first person\" is pretty ego-centric, basically telling how clever, strong, brave and good-looking he or she is. The narrating character, Atticus O'Sullivan, got all that down pat, and I got wearied pretty quickly on that aspect. The second thing is the rather demeaning attitude towards Christianity and Christian practices, more so than of other human religious concepts mentioned in the early part of the book. Druidism is expected to be praised, of course, but then Atticus seems to think he's the greatest druid that ever lived! The third thing is that this story came across as a \"punch-the-macho-button\" tale. There is sex (Atticus himself with women, and the lust his wolfhound dog, with which Atticus communicates telepathically, has for poodles), hunting (big horn sheep, etc.), apparent unemotional killing and fighting and, to some extent, drinking. Besides, one would expect a man that is 2000 years old to have gotten over the twenty-something male attitudes. I do not expect that further reading would show Atticus behaving in a more mature way. And finally, in his disguise as a \"mystic shop\" owner, he panders to customers wanting such as tarot cards, religious iconic knick-knacks, and questionable herbal concoctions, again, not admirable in my opinion.There are too many other books on my to-read list to waste any more time on this one.I would definitely not recommend this to kids.I imagine those readers who love this book and the series might disagree, especially since I could not finish the story, but I thought my assessment might keep some readers from wasting money on a book they might not like."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.669570"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.669570"]]

Kevin Hearne has a strong potential to be the next Jim Butcher.” ~The Founding FieldsAs long term Founding Fields fans will know, The Dresden Files are my favourite urban fantasy series on the market today – although I don’t read that much in the genre. The last Dresden-esque book that I read held the title Fated by Benedict Jacka which was entertaining but ultimately didn’t do much else. Hounded on the other hand… I really enjoyed, and I must say I was glad to receive a review copy through NetGalley.Atticus O’Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old—when in actuality, he’s twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he’s hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power—plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a sexy bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish—to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil.I really enjoyed Hounded. It was a fresh, if flawed opening start to a series and as I was reading it I felt like I was in the middle of some weird combination of Joss Whedon and Jim Butcher with plenty of Irish inspiration. Although the writing style is simplistic, it flows well and manages to prove enjoyable and entertaining - especially with some great comedy moments between Atticus and Oberon, his dog, who is probably one of the greatest not-fully-human-and-shouldn’t-really-be-able-to-talk companions since Bob the Skull. However, despite his age – there are several parts in this novel where Atticus acts way too young for his age delivering something that a teenager would probably think was witty. There was an element of this in The Dresden Files but not as heavily as in The Iron Druid Chronicles.Read the Rest of the Review: http://thefoundingfields.com/2012/11/....

However, the lovely Gigi at DDLF (www.ddlf.net) our paranormal romance and urban fantasy website site set the Iron Druid books as one of our August challenges.And let me tell you I am glad that she did. This book is smart and very very funny. The book is about Atticus a 2000 year old druid and his dog Oberon and their fight against some old Irish Gods. It doesn't sound particularly exciting I know, but the beauty of this book is the cleverness of the writing. Atticus is super snarky and his relationship with Oberon (a french poodle and sausage obsessed grey wolfhound) is endearing and amusing.The beginning of the book can be a bit confusing and there are lots of references to mythology that people may not be familiar with. However, these references aren't integral to the plot and you can easily ignore them (or google them).The book contains lots of snarky references to popular culture which are really funny, my two favourite being:\"Pillow talk in the modern era often involves the sharing of childhood stories or perhaps an exchange of dream vacations. One of my recent partners, a lovely lass named Jesse with a tattoo of a Tinker Bell on her right shoulder blade, had wanted to discuss a science-fiction television program, Battlestar Galactica, as a political allegory for the Bush years. When I confessed I had no knowledge of the show nor any interest in getting to know it or anything about American politics, she called me a “frakkin’ Cylon” and stormed out of the house, leaving me confused yet somewhat relieved.\"\"What sealed the deal for me was that the cloak wouldn’t come off without a generous donation of my tears. Those used to be almost impossible for me to summon, I admit, until I watched Field of Dreams. When Kevin Costner asks his dad at the end if he’d like to have a catch, I just completely lose my shit. Any guy who doesn’t is either in mixed company when he sees it or was blessed with an unusually sensitive father.\"There are three books out currently, the fourth Tricked, is released in April 2012.If you want a clever read which will make you laugh out loud then this book is definitely for you.

There is a bunch of odd stuff with his dog (to whom he's psychically linked) wanting to screw a harem of poodles (which raised questions: \"If they're psychically linked, can he hear his dog fucking other dogs in his head?\" came just after \"wouldn't a wolfhound kill a poodle if it tried to have sex with it?\"), questionable sexual politics about having women (Witches) be simultaneously either objectified or Evil (or both!) throughout the whole book and a really peculiar section where he spent a whole page justifying to the reader why it was OK for him to backhand a woman across the face.Here's a hint to any and all authors, aspiring or otherwise:If you find yourself justifying punching a woman for a page, or writing a sentence that starts \"Call me a chauvinist, but...\" or having your dude get grinded on by a hot naked death-Goddess... put that pen the fuck down and don't pick it up again until you can guarantee that shit will not happen.That said; the buddy dialogue between he and his dog is mostly good fun, it's an easy, breezy read, the Druid hiding behind his Lawyers and the pressure his Fae adversaries can exert over him by breaking human laws and forcing him to deal with the consequences is a neat conceit and the writing actually had germs of goodness in it from time to time.

Unfortunately, I found the two characters to be nothing alike, and the book not as good as I expected. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable book that compelled me to read it all one sitting.A minor but frustrating issue Hounded has is a distinct lack of contractions, leading to slightly stilted conversations. A bigger issue is the seeming invincibility of the main character; despite the supposed limitations of his Druidic magic and the supposed strength of his foes, Atticus uses magic to solve all of his problems as easily as he uses his sword to defeat his enemies. At no point during the book did I actually feel he was in a tight spot. But the biggest issue, for me, at least, was how incredibly modern and human everyone seemed. Ancient gods, 2000-year-old Druids, vampires, werewolves, and even Atticus' pet dog all act just like your next-door-neighbor. This could have been interesting and amusing, but wound up just being awkward. Still, Hounded is a good book. I read the entire thing in one day because I couldn't put it down, and I will definitely be reading the next one. The world Hearne creates has a lot of potential (even if the gods are pretty unbelievable), and his characters are compelling. I originally gave this book only three stars, but felt obliged to up the rating, since I wanted to read the next one so badly I ran out and bought it when I discovered my library didn't have a copy. Since I almost never do that, Hounded obviously deserved another star.

It allowed me to appreciate the suspense without distraction and provided breaks in the tension at just the right time. The contributions by Oberon were particularly entertaining. Watching Atticus and Oberon get out of one tight spot after another kept me turning the pages! I like to play \"connect the dots\" when it comes to mystery elements. At one point, I wondered where the story was going and how in the world the author would tie all the plot points together. He accomplished the task smoothly and thoroughly. In the end, I was very satisfied with the resolution and loved all the excitement. It was also nice not to be bogged down with world building.Hearne has created a fun group of characters and has a wonderful grasp on their personalities. His Fae characters act and speak in an Old World style, clearly setting them apart from the Average Joe. It creates many interesting moments of humor for Atticus as he straddles both worlds.

Anthropomorphism is and has been for decades one of my favorite things. There is plenty of it in this story. Atticus lives in harmony with nature but not so much with the series of gods he contends with. Hearne had solid character development so you get a good idea on Atticus as a protagonist. Vampires, werewolves, witches, gods, goddesses, succubae and other colorful and mystic characters are introduced. The cast is set for multiple sequels. I enjoyed the way the concept of the Iron Druid was introduced.

I was very hard pressed to believe any goddesses worth their salt spoke as insipidly as the ones in this book did, or any women really. They were not believable at all for me.

Not perfect, but fun. My comment at one point was to the effect that this felt like an Irish whiskey-flavored Dresden. It’s not Dresden – Harry is still the king of urban fantasy (and Mercy Thompson is the (unrelated) queen) – but it was … well, fun.There was some reluctance on the part of the male half of the group to read this, in large part because of the cover. I like it, a lot. Hey, he has his shirt on, I don’t know what the problem is … Unless it’s that it garnered quite a bit of, shall we say enthusiasm? – from the female half. Pride, and prejudice. I like it. I like the ones for the second and third books even better.Anyway. It wasn’t PNR (paranormal romance). There was something that might be considered a romantic element, but which was actually simply the main character having sex with any willing female. It wasn’t graphic, and some of the willingness was more along the lines of insistence, some of the females in question being in fact goddesses… Whatever. Atticus didn’t mind.Atticus O’Sullivan is he who is hounded, in more ways than one. (It’s kind of a great title.) He is a 2100 year old Druid, powerful and determined to add a couple more millennia to his tally. A while back – a long while – he absconded with a sword of great power, and ever since then one of the gods, Aengus Óg, has been after him to claim it. Fortunately for Atticus, not all of the Irish gods are on the same page, and he has some partisans – most notably the Morrígan, goddess of battle and fertility – and death. She’s the maiden and mother and crone, the one who claims the souls of the dead under her purview – and she has refrained from taking Atticus’s soul on a few occasions when she had a right to it. (Which doesn’t mean that the god or spirit of death from some other faith can’t snatch him, so her restraint is no guarantee of immortality. All gods are real, in this world – Jesus and Mary are great people, thanks very much, though Americans’ image of them is so muddled that they can’t appear as often as others. Can’t argue with that.) The Morrígan is not quite an ally, quite – but she’s on roughly the same side. Mostly. From Wikipedia: “She sometimes appears in the form of a crow, flying above the warriors, and in the Ulster cycle she also takes the form of an eel, a wolf and a cow.” – Here she is often the crow; the ability to appear in a quartet of animal shapes is something Kevin Hearne weaves into the story. Well done.The other aspect of the pun in the title is Atticus’ constant companion, an Irish wolfhound named Oberon – otherwise known as the most universally adored part of the book according to the other reviews I’ve looked at. He’s a rescue whom Atticus has taught to speak mind to mind, and who provides both heart and simple fun to the story. I loved Oberon. Not nearly as much as Harry Dresden’s Mouse; but he was lovely. My only hesitation was that his thoughts were in sentences a little too well-constructed, his vocabulary a little too broad. I would not want a book full of “Me want poodle”, but a little more simplicity would have felt more right to me. There was a “doggy” feel to some of his comments, but it was the sort of “doggy” that you get in cartoons – happy, eager, simple, and a little slobbery. I liked it, it read well for me for the most part, but it was a bit too humanized. The goddesses who made appearances seemed to function on a more basic level than Oberon – but I pretty much excused it as a result of hanging out with a Druid. That’s bound to have an effect.Another quibble I had with the book – and it is explained, but is still a quibble – was Atticus’s power. He’s just about as powerful as the gods – more powerful, in fact, as he has defeated a couple. Killed them. Granted, he’s brilliant and has had a couple of millennia to hone his power, whereas the gods seem to use their time in pursuit of amusement for the most part … Thing is, though, if Atticus is so brilliant, and he’s trying to hide out from Aengus in Arizona, why does he use the name O’Sullivan? His actual, original name is (insert version of Seamus O’Sullivan here) – it doesn’t take a Druid to figure out that O’Sullivan is simply the Anglicization of his name. Not that it’s the most uncommon name there is, but still – why not at least go with O’Malley or something? (Sorry – minor Dresden humor.) It’s a small quibble, but a quibble nonetheless.This was well-written. I appreciated the depth of knowledge and respect Hearne seems to have for Celtic mythology and history; I appreciated the tone of the work, and the characterizations of the gods. The Celtic god of love is not Cupid. The sense of humor in the first-person narrative is one of the main reasons to become fond of Atticus – and the humor started with the dedication. (“Hey, Mom!”) It manages to avoid most of the clichés that have developed in urban fantasies, except perhaps in Mrs. MacDonagh (the elderly Irish widow neighbor of Atticus whose yard he keeps up, and whose eyes are opened in the course of the book to his actual nature); I’m not sure how I felt about her. She came the closest to being a “shure and begorrah!” kind of Irish character.One thing that came up in discussion of the book, which I didn’t really think of as I read but which clicked afterward, was the fact that putting your main character in peril when it’s a first-person narrative from his point of view is tricky – after all, if he’s telling me the story he obviously lived through it. (Jim Butcher manages, though …) Atticus may be a little too indestructible – and it’s no fun to read about the adventures of someone who can simply shrug off most dangers.Then again, the dangers that Atticus can’t shrug off are guaranteed to be big and bad – and therefore interesting. One more reason to look forward to the rest of the series.There is a pair (are? is.) of short stories available, one posted free on Hearne’s website. And it is in that story that I found this:“They were waiting for one of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and those were precisely the Irish gods from whom I was hiding. Originally they were mere Druids, like me, and were bound to the earth – as I am – through their tattoos. At first glance, it would be easy to mistake me for one of them.”Which actually throws me off … the Tuatha Dé are not usually human, by any stretching of the word. So now I’m having doubts about his worldbuilding. But it does go a ways toward explaining Atticus’s comparative strength.from Wikipedia commonsI’m not going to make a spectacular effort to get my hands on the rest of the series to date; three of the six projected books have been released to date, and I may just hold out a little while longer. But it’s nice to know there’s a series out there in which the Irish is a whiff of peat and whiskey, and not Lucky Charms. I’m grateful for that."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.800131"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.800131"]]

Nice covers, but want to shave that soul patch thingy. Anyway, when I found a copy of Hounded for sale at my library’s sale area, I grabbed it.The Premise: Atticus O’Sullivan is a two thousand year old Druid, but he looks anything but. In fact he looks like a young twenty-something kid and that’s the way he likes it. No one suspects that the young occult bookshop owner in Tempe, Arizona, is hiding from the Old Ones. A god named Aenghus Óg holds a grudge against Atticus because of a magic sword, and has been searching for him for hundreds of years. Whenever Atticus feels Aenghus get close, he usually moves, but this time Atticus is tired of running. Arizona is home turf, and a good place as any to take a stand against a god who is hellbent on destroying him. Atticus has made preparations and allies, but even so, it’s impossible to guess what tricks his longtime enemy may have up his sleeves.My Thoughts: Atticus O’Sullivan has been laying low for centuries, and he’s good at it. He’s over two thousands years old and the last living Druid. His latest residence is in Tempe, Arizona, which is as far from those hunting for him as possible, and blessedly low on gods and the Fae. Of course, given time, his enemies find him yet again, forcing Atticus to decide to run or make a stand. The sword Aenghus Óg is after is a big prize, and Atticus is visited by other gods and creatures with a stake in the outcome of the upcoming battle and who muddy the waters on who to trust.Despite all that hangs over his head, this is a fun main character. Atticus narrates with a keen awareness of the humor in almost every situation. It’s a constant source of amusement and an inside joke with the reader that he’s older than everyone he knows, including the local paranormals (a coven of witches and a pack of werewolves), while he pretends to be a “young-Irish-lad” (he hasn’t survived this long by being incautious). Helping to maintain this sense of humor is Atticus’ beloved Irish Wolfhound Oberon, with whom Atticus can speak to mind to mind. I love a dog sidekick (one of my favorite tropes), and the relationship between Atticus and Oberon is quite amusing and heartwarming. Here’s a sample mind-to-mind conversation between the two (Atticus is in italics, Oberon in ):[...] I don’t trust witches.No, she knows you’re here. She can see through the camouflage. But I think she’s hiding something from me, and I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.Never mind. Just listen. Once she drinks the tea, she will try to surprise me with something. She is waiting for the contract to be fully in effect before she says anything.I knew I never should have let you watch The Wizard of Oz.As the conversation shows, the humor in Hounded has a lot of pop culture references (but not obscure ones). This is big part of the humor in the book, as well as a sort of “foiling the bad guys is fun” schtick. What I mean by this is that Atticus goes though these trials and tribulations but you always end up feeling like he’s going to come out of it relatively unscathed, a “Phew, still alive” grin on his face. If I were to compare it to anything, I’d say that Atticus is like the urban fantasy version of Michael Westen from Burn Notice (if Michael Westen was a kick-ass Druid undercover as a twenty-one year old). It’s hard to believe that anyone is going to get the best of him. He’s so paranoid and he’s seen it all, plus he has his backup. Hounded has of several attempts by Atticus’ enemy to box him in, but Atticus survives because he plans ahead and thinks on his feet. And he has friends who will help him bury the bodies. After a reading string of darker urban fantasy, it was nice to sit back and just enjoy Atticus handling the latest debacle, which runs the gamut from goddesses to giants, getting knocked down in the process, but rallying pretty quickly (thanks to his Druid powers).Being a Druid is a pretty nice gig, particularly when it’s combined with Atticus’ accumulated knowledge. He’s figured out how to stay young for an extremely long time and how to ward off most attacking spells without selling his soul. Part of the world building in the story is explaining what being a Druid entails, but the other part is describing the supernatural world Atticus is aware of. In this series, all pantheons exist at the same time. It isn’t directly explained, but I understood the existence of deities and other mythical creatures to be a result of human belief. If an idea is worshiped by enough people, it will exist. This means that there may even be different versions of the same god (Thor is an example), in existence at the same time. There’s a mix of supernatural creatures and ideologies, but in Hounded the pantheon Atticus mostly deals with is from his own Irish upbringing. As for the setting, I have a lot of family who live in Arizona and Hearne captures the Tempe area like a true Arizona native. It was well done and made me look forward to my next visit (and also eager to check out some of the places referenced in the book).I don’t think Hounded really sets out to be serious, so when I think of my one complaint about the story (that I wish that there were deeper relationships between the characters), I’m not really sure I can make that complaint really stick. There are plenty of side characters, but hiding his past and his power is Atticus’ modus operandi. So far, the deepest relationship is the one between Atticus and Oberon, and I wish there was more than that, but the events in Hounded may have created an opportunity for relationship development in later books.Overall: Hounded is a refreshingly lighthearted urban fantasy. I liked the mix of action and improvisation, presented by a narrator who appreciates the comedy of pretending to be innocuous while being much, much older and more powerful than he appears. It made me smile often, which is quite a nice pick-me-up, and I’m looking forward to enjoying the next one."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.808395"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.808395"]]

(You have, too, haven't you? Sigh. Still, there are lots of beloved series that start off this way, so onward we read...)With a name like Hearne, how could the author not write a novel of the fae? He takes it one step further though and touches upon a concept I've always been fond of: every strong belief, every myth and legend you've heard of, has its physical manifestation. Humanity’s adoration and fear bestows power. We are our best defenders…and our own worst enemies. “…the universe is exactly the size that your soul can encompass. Some people live in extremely small worlds, and some live in a world of infinite possibility. You have just received some sensory input that suggests it’s bigger than you previously thought. What are you going to do to with that information? Will you deny it or embrace it?”Atticus asks this of his neighbour, stating exactly why we readers dive headlong into the sea of UF, splashing happily amidst all the wonder. We want Infinite Possibility.So, yes, I like the world. It gives Atticus a vast landscape to play in, and allows us the hope that pantheons of all sorts might be explored.Ah, Atticus. The hero is not quite heroic when first we meet - not in the classic sense of having a Greater Good mission. He’s a 21-centuries’ old druid who’s been in hiding most of his life. The loftiest goal he has is staying alive, and hey, I can’t really blame him. I think his attitude is reflective of his age, an idea he mentions with frequency in comparing himself to the powerful, long-lived beings he encounters. He wants to fly under the radar - an immensely practical outlook when we find out he's spent much of his life dodging encounters with invading hordes or capricious magic-users. Call it well-placed indignance over being treated as lesser. Call it his Druidic desire for balance. Whatever reasoning you choose, Atticus' beliefs are simple: leave well enough alone, live and let live. That might seem a rather hands-off approach for a hero to take, but as I said: Atticus didn’t initially strike me as the embodiment of the grand heroic ideals of epic. But maybe, he’s a hero for a more modern age. He’s turned off by the fae’s tendency towards instant gratification…or else. He thinks the Virgin Mary might get a lil too much of a kick out of her miraculous appearances to the faithful. He’s not a big fan of witches, seeing them as tricksy, backstabbing types. And yet, he’s content to let them all go about their business. He doesn’t feel any need to exert his will over them, to make them conform to his moral ideals. He adores what might be called the apathy of modern America - particularly in the artsy, University environment he calls home. His eccentricities now earn him slightly bewildered looks in the coffeehouse line, as opposed to getting him burned or stoned to death as they might have long ago and far away. After 2,000 years, he appreciates that every magic group or spiritual manifestation has as much right to existence as another. It’s not his place to meddle. Unless things get out of hand. And rather personal. Which, in Hounded, they do. Atticus makes use of all resources available (how else might he have lived so long?), making room in the story for beings of all kinds. He gets an A for playing well with others, an A+ for knowing when he’s in over his head and should enlist help, and another A+ for being a wily sort of bastard who has tricks galore up his sleeve. He’s not the most magical being in town and works hard to overcome any chinks in his armor. All of this adds up to a character I’d be willing to bet on when it comes to getting out of a mess.Which brings me to the plot. Atticus’ personality and MO leave little room for convenient plot devices - nothing comes all that easily to him. Through all his interactions, there is ample evidence of the effort that goes into Atticus’ success in evading/handling the Big Bad. Unfortunately, all this work comes at the price of pacing. In establishing the many resources Atticus uses, Hearne resorts to a lot of trekking hither and yon for meet and greets, as well as pop-ins by secondary characters to deliver warnings and updates. We also get a lot of Telling when it comes to Atticus’ history - which is necessary for understanding the lead, hence my label of FBS. It’s a shame that the plot took so long to get into full gear, but I anticipate improvement in this area. Another casualty of the slow pacing was my proper understanding of the feud between Atticus and the Big Bad. Maybe the whole thing was really more about hurt ego than anything else, but I felt as if I’d missed something along the way. Going back to the characters, I have to mention one in particular. Oberon. Yes, he’s a dog. And yes, he lets us see the softer side of Atticus from the beginning. More than that, he brings humor to the story with his doggie thoughts of fancy lady poodles and hunting expeditions. He’s reminiscent of Bob in the Dresden Files, always wanting to get out and about and chase some tail (ooooh, punny).Hounded may have taken too much time to get going, Atticus may have taken a while to grow on me, but overall I’m left with a positive impression of the series’ potential. I won’t call this book a must-read, but I will label the series One to Watch. Fingers crossed that next time ‘round, working within an already established world will give the pacing a running start."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.814230"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.814230"]]

Firstly, it was the first time I read a book written in a first person perspective as told from a man’s point of view. Secondly, it was really the first time I read a full-on Urban Fantasy book. Meaning, it didn’t have any real romantic elements to it. Thirdly, this was the first time since high-school that I read a book written by a man. Yup. My first time. Now I can go around saying that Kevin Hearne popped my “book written by a boy” cherry. Okay, that sounds a little creepy. Maybe I’ll just keep that between you and me…Hounded is a very full and busy book. Because of that, I am not even going to attempt to tell you what happens. Just know that it is all very entertaining and original stuff. The main hero in this series is Atticus and he is a Druid. *hi Atticus* Kevin has written such a wonderful and smart character. So smart! There wasn’t a moment where I didn’t like him. Atticus’ sense of humor is dry and clever and I often found myself giggling while reading his thoughts and dialogue. He is a strong contender for my favorite character list; that’s how much I enjoyed reading him.I also enjoyed each and every secondary character. From the werewolf lawyer to the elderly widow to the slightly possessed barmaid, they were all written extremely well. And Oberon, Atticus’ wolfhound, is probably my favorite of them all. Because he is magical, Atticus was able to teach Oberon to think so he could be understood. Therefore Atticus can converse with him in his mind. That dog is a riot! You know how sometimes in books talking animals are just a little much and border on (or just flat out sit on) cheesy-doo? That is not the case with Oberon. He brings out the caring side of Atticus (because one of his other sides is pretty much “it’s your shit so I don’t give a shit” but in the very best way). Hey, there is a reason why Atticus has survived for over twenty-one centuries! But trust me, the dog is made of awesome and you will instantly love him like I did.Every action, every item and every person comes along with an explanation. Now, that’s not necessarily a bad thing because in a very detailed world based on a mix of truth and myth, it’s sort of necessary so you don’t get completely lost. But it’s not something I’m really used to. I’m used to reading books that contain thought patterns like “Oh my, he’s hot. We should suck face” then “Oh my, she’s hot. We should suck face” then… you guessed it…they proceed to suck face. Okay, not really. The books I read tend to be more intelligent than that, but you catch my drift. The explanations that come along with Kevin’s story telling really help build the world he’s created out of Fae lore and pretty much every other type of mythological lore out there. It really works.When I reached the 50% mark of this book, I was really liking it and knew I would want to continue on with this series but I just didn’t see myself wanting to run out to the bookstore immediately after reaching ‘the end’ to buy it. Well… Once I actually reached ‘the end’, I told Jason that we needed to get into the car and drive the 40 or so minutes to the nearest bookstore because I just had to buy Hexed and read it immediately. (Not because it has a cliff hanger ending but because I just wanted to keep reading these characters!) I am crazy swamped with my reading schedule, and it will be even worse now that I’ve squeezed in a book, but it’s totally worth it. Fantasy book lovers everywhere, check out this book. Yes, it’s that good.

Boy, did these ladies know what they were talking about. Hounded was such a fun book, and the audiobook narrator, Luke Daniels, was seriously awesome. Reason Number One You Should Read (or listen to) This Book: Oberon. I can't actually think of another animal character in any book I've ever read that made me laugh as much as he did. Oberon is a giant Irish Wolfhound who's obsessed with French poodles and Italian sausage. Thanks to a little bit of Druid magic, he's able to communicate mentally with the protagonist of the book, Atticus. His commentary on everything from women to history to citrus air fresheners had me literally laughing out loud off and on throughout the entire book. Oberon has quickly found himself a special place in my heart.Reason Number Two: If you're anything like me, and you geek out over obscure references...whether they be from history, literature, or pop culture, then this book is definitely one for you. It is FULL of references...from historical figures like Galileo and Genghis Khan to modern day allusions (Battlestar Galactica, Monty Python, and Field of Dreams, just to name a few). Reason Number Three: MYTHOLOGY! And not just of the Greek and Roman variety. Kevin Hearne does an excellent job of weaving together all kinds of mythologies from cultures all over the world. There are references to Norse gods and goddesses, witches, werewolves, vampires, druids, angels, demons, ghouls...you name it. Reason Number Four: It has appeal for both male and female readers. Unfortunately, when it comes to the various sub-genres of fantasy, a lot of books (though definitely not all) are heavily aimed toward either the male OR female audiences, and not both. Hounded is one of those books that I honestly wouldn't have a problem recommending to any of my friends, regardless of gender. Reason Number Five: Because Hounded is unlike anything else I've read in this genre. And I read a LOT, guys! One of the downsides of being a fan of particular genre is that, if you read enough of it, there will eventually come a time when a lot of books start to sound similar to one another, and when that happens, it's easy to hit burnout. Hounded is fresh and exciting. It actually made me excited to get up early in the morning and head to campus because I could listen to fifteen or twenty minutes of it before class. And trust me, making me excited about waking up and spending my entire day at the university at this point in the semester is NOT an easy feat."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.824800"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.824800"]]

If I’m going sleeveless and they see the tattoos all up and down my right arm, they assume I’m in a rock band and smoke lots of weed. It never enters their mind for a moment that I could be an ancient Druid — and that’s the main reason why I like this look. If I grew a white beard and got myself a pointy hat, oozed dignity and sagacity and glowed with beatitude, people might start to get the wrong — or the right — idea.\"\n4 starsThere are so few books that have a decent male POV or maybe it's me who haven't found much of those books. It's always nice to find a new Urban Fantasy series that is a refreshing change from your typical paranormal stories. Atticus O’Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old--when in actuality, he’s twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.This is an extremely well written story full of snarky lines that are so refreshing and enjoyable.The relationship between Atticus and Oberon (his wolfhound) was borderline adorable. I also enjoyed how the gods and goddesses speech was entirely different and how formal and full of thought they seemed to give each line. \n  “He came out of a building called ‘Crussh,’ holding one of these potions. Are you familiar with the building, Druid?” “I believe that is a smoothie bar in England.” “Quite right. So after I killed him and stowed his body next to the doe, I sampled his smoothie concoction in the parking lot and found it to be quite delicious.” See, sentences like that are why I nurture a healthy fear of the Tuatha Dé Danann.\nHounded is a great read — a wonderful hero with the perfect sidekick, colorful secondary characters, and just the right sense of humor.How can one freeze and put their hands above their head at the same time?

A friend suggested I DNF HOUNDED due to a few scenes that were just a little too weird for my tastes. The thought had never crossed my mind, which I think attests to Hearne's ability to draw me into his universe, even while making me have a few \"wah?!\" moments.Let me tell you right now I am so glad I did not give up. I know that, if any readers are like me, they may say \"to hell with this book\" once they reach a certain point--especially if they are not 100% hooked by then. It happens. But if you stick with HOUNDED, the final showdown (which is so incredibly badass and amazing that my jaw dropped due to its sheer awesomeness), it will more than make up for the slow buildup. Besides, while things are a little slow in the beginning, Oberon and Hal more than make up for it. They are by far my two favorites from the story due to the humor that they bring. Sorry Atticus, I like you and all, but your dog and lawyer won my heart.Considering this is my first urban fantasy I successfully finished with a male protagonist (the Black Jewels Trilogy was the only other series I could stomach with a hero--or three--as the lead), I'd have to give kudos to Hearne. I eagerly anticipate the next book in this series, HEXED, which comes out on June 7th. And, just because I'm superficial, I would totally buy the second book just for that cover. What a hottie!I definitely recommend checking HOUNDED out. There's just so many elements to this novel that are refreshingly different from urban fantasy that's out there already, that you'd be crazy not to give this story a shot. I also think I learned a bit while reading, which is always a plus!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.831803"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.831803"]]

The story follows Atticus, a 2,100 year old druid. He 'acquired' a magical fae sword some millennia ago, and not everyone thinks he should be allowed to keep it, so he's been hiding in plain sight in Arizona for several years, trying to stay under the radar. He's now sick of all the running, and this story is about what happens when he decides to stop and fight. HOUNDED had an abundance of wonderful, rich mythology, and I felt like I learned a lot without even trying to. Because thankfully, Hearne delivers it all in such a way that when you met a god or goddess, you felt like you were being given an introduction to a character, and not just the wikipedia breakdown of who they were, which is so often the case with other authors who use existing mythology as the backbone to their work. In fact, I was more than pleasantly surprised by the story telling in general. Especially for a debut novel. I also love the fact that all three books currently out in this series were released a month apart from each other like one big sucker punch. What a year for Kevin Hearne!The book had various supernatural races. We saw vampires, weres, gods and goddesses, witches and fae to name but a few. A lovely, big melting pot of all my favourite things. I actually would give it four and a half stars if that were possible, but what's preventing it from being a five, and what I would really like for the next book, is for our protagonist, Atticus, to develop some closer personal relationships. Other than his dog, there isn't really anyone Atticus is close to and I missed reading about those kinds of relationships. The closest people in his life appear to be his lawyers and his employee. Which is just a little bit sad......I look forward to reading the next instalment. I can't remember the last time I read a book from a first person male perspective. So many urban fantasy books have female leads, so it was a nice change.Frivolous aside: This series has some wicked cover art. It's definitely what made me look into the books when I usually only look out for books with sword or gun-wielding chicks on the front.

And, it may actually be 4, but for the \"expectations\" scale. That is, based on the reviews, I expected more from this book than it delivered to me. My mind frequently wandered, and that is never a good thing.The druid based magic system was very intriguing. I really liked the tattoo idea and the relationship to the earth. The logic and reasoning for the final battle also felt very in character and I do not think I would have accepted any other argument. I am still a bit confused as to the gods and goddesses and fae and Tuatha De Dannan and how they relate to each other. (I also appreciated the author's presentation of Irish pronunciations - and his permission to pronounce any which way I chose.)As a dog lover, I adored Oberon. Was it a little over the top? Maybe. But, I didn't mind. Unfortunately, Atticus' relationship with Oberon is really the only ongoing \"relationship\" in the story - I really missed an emotional connection to any other character in the book. I strongly suspect this is to be corrected in the next book as some seemed to be being set-up in this novel - obviously the first in a series. That being said, he is very kind to the old widow down the street - and obviously cared - but it is a very peripheral relationship.And, the contemporariness of Atticus bothered me. Here is this thousands of years old druid - yet he talks and acts as if he really *is* 21. I certainly understand the need for him to blend in with others his apparent age, but I should still think that there should be some age and wisdom visible to the reader - and there really is not. In addition, his reaction to every female in the novel was on a visceral level, as if there were no other reason to relate to a person of the opposite gender.I did enjoy this book. I certainly did not feel myself immersed in his world. I did feel like it was setting up characters for more novels. As such, I am undecided as to whether or not I actually cared enough to see where they go: part of me thinks there is so much more to Atticus and part of me really wonders."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.859765"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.859765"]]

That it has the same modern-old-soul as the Dresden Files feel only adds to its charm. I should mention that this was Kevin Hearn debut novel. It doesn't feel that way.

That combination is simply awesome. Atticus in his pursuit of enjoying his addiction to breathing has researched and the use of magic even while being in contact with iron which the Fae simply detest. Giving him a very measurable advantage against his number one nemesis Aenghus Óg one of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Aenghus is trying to recover a sword Fragarah which Atticus has conveniently borrowed over the past 2 millennia. Which brings us to our current story and how he runs into trouble with the local Witch coven (I'm starting to believe they are like your Local Union they are everywhere) as they have taken sides, choosing Aenghus based on future privileges. All the while we are introduced to other members of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Oberon fulfills his companion and comedic relief at times. Atticus himself is sarcastic towards the beliefs most humans attribute to that other world we don't know exists. Which is similar to Harry's point of view.

Since I already did that on Twitter, I'm going to let YOU know how awesome Hounded is.I read quite a few reviews of this book, and I will honestly say my expectations were VERY high. That is never a good thing for me to carry into a book with me. I must say that I still managed to be impressed with Mr. Hearne's debut novel. Here are a few things that stood out for me:1) His characters are well-researched. Mr. Hearne knows his business, which is good since he's using \"real\" deities in his books (yes, there will be more!). It also gives the mortal characters a certain relatability because he has taken time to make a backstory for them. Well, except for the witches perhaps, but I'll forgive him for that since there are two more books coming out this summer.2) There are an abundance of pop culture references! There is a little bit thrown in for everyone. By everyone, I mean people like me because the rest of you do not matter. Just kidding. Kinda. Anyway, his characters fit into the modern world because they like MODERN things. And Atticus is a bit of a sexy dork, not unlike myself.3)The plot is woven intelligently well. By this I mean that everything ties together so far. One thing leads to another without being too predictable. Mr. Hearne wrapped up Hounded quite well, but left a nice lead-in for Hexed. All of that being said, I will HAVE Hexed the day it comes out, even if I have to go to Barnes amp; Noble's storage room myself to find it.

It is smart without being pretentious, exciting and funny but not too silly, and just plain good fun to read. What is really impressive to me was that Hearne manages to incorporate Jesus and Mary, Celtic, Norse, and even Polish deities alongside fae, Druids, vampires, werewolves and witches and it makes logical sense and doesn't feel like a cluttered, thrown together mishmash. With some authors it feels as though they just should have picked a few elements and stuck to them, that trying to put in every fantasy element that they've always dreamed about makes their premise too mixed up and confusing. But Hearne's premise works perfectly well with all of the characters he included and his storytelling is so crisp and clean that I never felt overwhelmed by the various names or magics being used, it all just worked. It makes a lot of sense that the publishers asked Nicole Peeler to do the blurb on the back cover since she's another author who managed to accomplish the same thing beautifully; both authors have written books that use a lot of extremely interesting history and mythology but never for a moment sacrifice entertainment and storytelling. And this book has the added joy of including a very charming Irish wolfhound! None of my friends will be surprised to see that I adored Oberon. But read the book, I promise that you will too. And I'm sure that Atticus will take his place as a favorite character in urban fantasy circles, he's just a great character who I can't wait to see more from.

After finishing the book, I can tell you that I laughed out loud almost every chapter! I highly recommend the audio version of this story as Luke Daniels did an excellent job.What I Loved: The humor in this story was probably one of the best I have read. Atticus (the lead) and Oberon (his dog) were a great buddy duo and even though I guess technically not a bromance, it almost was. I loved the interaction between these two and just a warning, sausages are magic at least according to Oberon (and probably every dog on the planet). It might be because I am a dog lover but I dare anyone not to fall in love with this book based on Oberon alone. Let's talk Atticus though, he is a fun lead who is smart, funny, and quite frankly great at standing up for what he believes.What I Liked: I am trying not to give anything away so this will be very generic. All of the side characters in this story are very well-written. There are so many different types of characters involved that you have to appreciate the amount of work Kevin Hearne put into creating this world. The main storyline was very engaging and I kept wanting to rush to the end to see how it played out. I am very glad that I have books 2 and 3 already to continue the journey.Complaints: NoneWhy I gave it a 4.25: This was a fun ride that I would recommend to anyone who reads Fantasy books and even those that don't.

He’s an extremely old Druid who is in possession of a magical sword that someone else wants. This someone is prepared to stop at nothing in his attempts to get this magical sword. Readers/listeners are given small flashbacks of Atticus’s very long life that tie into the current happenings of his present day life. Atticus has a great personality that has the perfect mix of humor, snark and easy going attitude surrounded by self-preservation. Atticus was a great character to follow through this tale. I loved his friends and LOVED his talking Irish wolfhound Oberon. Oberon provided a ton of unexpected comedy. Luke Daniel’s does a marvelous job of narrating this tale. I think the audio helped me enjoy this book more than I would have had I been reading the print version of Hounded. I do not read fae based urban fantasy due to the words.

For a two thousand year Druid he kept it pretty real and didn’t beat around the bush with things. I also loved that he was a bit of a player.

Atticus’ side kick, Oberon, was one funny dog too. His love of sausages and French poodles is incomparable. \\tI also have to say this was a fun audio to listen too.

It starts out pretty benignly, and you hope that soon the author will give more flesh to his character. The lead is hopelessly one dimensional and everything is simply told to the reader: He's got a sword, he's a druid, and everyone wants to either a) bang him b) kill him c) both. Without looking at the author it becomes painfully obvious the book was written for a man, by a man. Atticus (the lead) talks about 5 or 6 different sexual encounters within the first 40 pages of the book. Hearne's disregard for anything plot worthy becomes painfully obvious. Such fine and vital plot points like \"What's a druid?\" or \"How did Atticus learn to meld iron into his aura?\" is shoved to the side for naked Morrigan, Goddess of Death and War, giving him a passionate kiss that made him want to \"hump her leg\". I'm fine with some sauciness in books. Hell, I've read more graphic things than this (all sexual encounters mentioned are extremely tame), however the plot takes a definite back seat role as we as readers are forced to ooh and awe over Atticus' good looks, swords, fighting ability, and talent for getting laid. By page 40 it is no longer hinted that Atticus has had relations with various Goddesses, he has just finished having sex with one. Her reason for doing this? So she could learn about his sword.Do yourself a favor and get a better book."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.899768"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:47.899768"]]

Also, for once he's a druid and not a witch/wizard/other kind of supernatural, which I very seldom read about, except in my history/anthropology books about Gaul, that is.I'm a little undecided regarding the balance of supernaturals introduced here (witches, vampires, werewolves) on top of the Celtic deities. This could be a nice addition later, or it could just backfire.The plot was the weakest part for me, in that all things considered, it doesn't evolve a lot, and the novel reads as an introduction to the world developed by the author, with hints put in places for the next books, rather than as a full-fledged story. (Speaking of hints, I'm quite intrigued by a certain human character, who doesn't seem so fazed when fae warriors get killed on the lawn in front of the house, and accepts \"the big explanation\" a little too easily.

I'm glad I did. We both enjoyed the book very much.Atticus is a very old druid who has been living in hiding for years running an occult shop in Tempe, Arizona. When it seems his old enemy is finally on the move against him he is quickly thrown back into the fray against Gods, witches, fae, and many other monsters. Together with his chatty dog Oberon, two lawyers (a vampire and a werewolf), various other monsters and fairy tale creatures, and a very old supportive widow next door, Atticus is off to finish a battle that was started 2000 years ago. Like everyone I think my daughter and I loved Oberon the most. The dialogue between Atticus and his dog is just fantastic, and funny. The widow down the street is a real hoot and made several scenes of the book just fantastic. All of the supporting characters were interesting and I look forward to delving deeper into their stories as the series progresses. Lots of action, maybe a bit too much and possibly why I only gave it four stars instead of more.

I tried the audiobook for the second book and was driven off by Luke Daniels's rendition of Oberon. Recently I (shall we say) came across Hounded in audio, and decided to give the medium another shot. While I tolerated the Oberon voice better this time around (I'll come back to that), unfortunately I enjoyed the book less. See, I love Harry Dresden. Really, really love. Like hands-clasped hearts-in-eyes \"My hero!\" love. And one incident not too far into Hounded illustrated very clearly why I don't and will never feel that way about Atticus O'Sullivan. The Morrigan, with a fine disregard for 21st century proprieties is confronting him in his store, stark naked. Two frat boys straggle in hoping to score some pot, see a beautiful naked woman, and react in the only way stoner frat boys could possibly react. The Morrigan takes offense at their temerity and issues their death warrant. Atticus mildly tries to derail her vengeance, but she is set on killing those who dared look upon her and make note of her nudity, and he gives a mental shrug. Oh well. Guess they'll die. And that's the end of that episode. Now, unless I'm gravely mistaken, that is not how the story would run if it was Harry and not Atticus by-standing; I can't believe Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden would not have found a way, some way, to save the two morons, however undeserving they might be – and however much of his own blood and pain it might cost him. I can't help being judge-y about a great and powerful druid whose two thousand years have honed him into a really very self-serving and self-centered person. It was also a little troubling that he takes moral objection to Laksha's nasty habit of bumping souls out of their bodies – it's terrible and unforgivable – but the slightly eye-widening body count he racks up is perfectly fine. He excuses it at some point by pointing out that his druidic beliefs include reincarnation – killing someone just ensures that they'll be moving on to their next life that much sooner. But Laksha's faith says much the same thing. Good lord, werewolves in this universe can't control themselves better than to just change in front of a muggle? That's pathetic. I did very much like \"Shut up. I'm Irish.\" But I was otherwise not nearly as favorably impressed by Hearne's take on Irishness this time around. Yeah, Atticus O'Sullivan is not one of my favorite people right now.And, sadly, neither is his hound Oberon. I loved him to pieces when I first read the book, as most people seem to. This time I had a harder time reconciling the not-quite-smart but very-much-not-stupid dialogue assigned to him with the fact that he's an adult Irish wolfhound. It made me a little queasy, actually – what did Atticus do to him to make him this way? At times he came off as a child, irrepressible and sometimes silly; at times he came off as much more intelligent, pulling out references that seemed unlikely, and providing tactical and philosophical insight; then a little while later he'd be making me cringe again with his obsession with Genghis Khan. I didn't remember the inconsistency in his portrayal, but it felt glaringly obvious this time. And the whole French poodle fixation was nauseating. That little tag at the end in which he gets his surprise made me surprisingly – well, again, queasy. That's kind of my takeaway from Oberon this go-round: deep uneasiness. Not to mention that this time round I was for whatever reason less forgiving of what was basically a ripoff of H. Beam Piper's Fuzzies, in which adorable furry teddy-bear-appearing sentient [sic] creatures develop obsessions on historical figures and throw themselves into recreating those figures as accurately as diminutive furry creatures can. The narration by Luke Daniels was excellent – mostly. Accents, and voices young and old, male and female, stoner and werewolf and goddess – all well done. But you know what I still hated? Oberon. Every single time he voiced a line from the wolfhound I expected it to end with a \"Ruh roh, Raggy!\" or a full-on silly Don Messick Scooby giggle. This might have had a lot to do with my Oberon issues described above – but not everything. Some books you just want to read over and over, and love more with each revisit. Some books, apparently, should be read only once.

His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old — when in actuality, he’s twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer. Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he’s hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down…The book begins with verve as Atticus is a charming narrator who introduces us to his friends, who are mainly from the supernatural world. We meet Druid gods, local werewolves, a Viking vampire, the local coven of witches, and Atticus’s Irish wolfhound, Oberon, with whom Atticus can carry on mental conversations. There are few genuine humans in Atticus’s life and none are developed beyond a paltry few amusing characteristics, such as the Irish widow who likes to get drunk before going to Mass and forgives murder on her lawn if she is told the victims were British. The most likable character in the group is the dog Oberon who is charmingly focused on doggish things and has just enough understanding of Atticus’s world to offer his own solutions from time to time.My initial attraction to the story soon ground to a halt. The problem with this book, and it is a large problem, is that Atticus is a perpetual Peter Pan character. His emotional development seems to be frozen at several years younger than his outward 21 years since a heaving bosom is all it takes to permanently distract him from whatever he’s doing. Pity. One would have hoped that 2,100 years of living would result in a certain amount of experience leading to wisdom. Instead, Atticus spends more time in a practical joke on an ambulance attendant than in thinking through how much he should have healed himself from a bullet wound to make it seem convincing to local law enforcement. That’s ok though because Atticus has friends and allies who unfailingly show up to give an easy solution without readers ever feeling that Atticus himself is too worried about the outcome. This leads to a permanent lack of dramatic tension.It’s a pity there isn’t a “Wendy” to accompany Atticus’s “Peter Pan.” That would give Hounded the necessary depth and contrast. Now we can see how wise J.M. Barrie was in the construction of his tale. Without a truly human element who lacks control of the situation, all the adventures are one boring episode after another with nary a worry about how Atticus will escape.The one good thing about this book is the narrator, Luke Daniels. I haven’t come across him before but will keep an eye out for him in the future. His talents kept me listening long past the point where I would have given up. His voicing of Oberon has found its way into my head whenever we “speak” for the dogs in our household.Sadly, Daniels’ talents aren’t enough to make this shallow story worth your time. There are many wonderful YA stories out there that are worth reading and rereading: The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, Eon: Dragoneye Reborn by Alison Goodman, White Cat by Holly Black, and Assam and Darjeeling by T.M. Camp are just a few.For that matter, try Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie. You’ll see what Hounded could have been with proper attention given to the storytelling."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.139783"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.139783"]]

I love Harry Dresden, he's still my favorite wizard, and I definitely look for more stories similar to that in sense. Let me just say that now, THIS BOOK ROCKS! Let me count the ways on why I love it(1) The writing is SO ENTERTAINING!! Be careful Harry (and you too, Cal Leandros), there is a new guy in town with quips as amusing and smart and witty and funny like you!! Atticus O'Sullivan amuses me throughout. Even from the first paragraph, I am hooked. \"There are many perks to living for twenty-one centuries, and foremost among them is bearing witness to the rare birth of genius. It invariably goes like this: Someone shrugs off the weight of his cultural traditions, ignores the baleful stares of authority, and does something his countrymen think to be completely batshit insane. Of those, Galileo was my personal favorite. Van Gogh comes in second, but he really was batshit insane. (Chapter 1)(2) Added with a faithful Irish wolfhound, Oberon, who gives witty stand-up comedians run for their money, and probably one of my most favorite DOGS ever in an urban fantasy series (aside from Remy Chandler's Marlowe -- Harry's dog, Mouse, cannot talk!), I am in whole lot of glee reading their words exchange! \"\n   Oberon said once Brighid had left, \" (Chapter 14)(3) The myths and having a 2,100-year old Druid (who still looks like he's 21 years old) in the main seat as the hero. I am not truly familiar with Irish or Celtic Myths but I surely enjoy reading them. I don't even have it in me to feel discomfort of reading the names (I have to thank Mark Del Franco and his \"Connor Grey\" series for that :p) -- I just think it adds the nuance of the story. Plus it's just nice reading the description that Mr. Hearne adds, like \"the Morrigan, goddess of war\", \"Flidais, goddess of the hunt\", etc. Then a Druid for a hero is definitely a nice change of the cluttered vampires/shapeshifters characters out there. seem to have a good streak with non vampires/shapeshifters series (wizards, Fae, even Djinn), so I totally welcome Druid. (4) Having said that, other preternatural beings like vampires, werewolves, witches, ghouls, even demons are present and accounted for. They are part of the story, intricated very nicely and a great secondary characters. Darn you, Atticus, I definitely want to have werewolves and vampire as my attorney as well. They sure come handy *lol*(5) The story is fast-paced, easily followed, with a couple of twists thrown in the way before the climax... if I have a complaint (which is why no 5-star ratings yet), is that I feel the ending is wrapped too nicely. (view spoiler)[Considering that Atticus has avoided Aenghus Óg for two millenias, I don't feel like the final battle does the justice. I guess I want things to be more, uhm, explosive? Atticus gets help from Brighid and the Morrigan in defeating Aenghus Óg, so I feel a bit cheated on that as well. I guess I want to see it more from his own power?

I remember being excited by the initial buzz the title was receiving upon its release but for some reason shuffled it somewhere back into the deep recesses of my memory. Eventually I picked up the audiobook version via Audible and after several long weeks managed to finish it. This isn’t the fault of Hearne’s work merely the thousand other aural delights screaming for my attention combined with my own bizarre decision to only listen while running; truthfully a result of my utter failure to sync Audible apps across multiple portable devices). Yay, technology.Hounded, with its urban fantasy vibe and male lead, is bound to be compared to Butcher’s Dresden Files but, in truth I’m not quite sure that comparison fits. Hounded stars ancient druid Atticus O’Sullivan who has long been hiding the magical sword Fragarach from the Celtic love god (and all around douche) Aengus Og. As the novel opens it becomes readily apparent that Aengus has once again tracked Atticus down and intends to recover the sword, no matter what. Needless to say this causes Atticus no end of trouble and Hearne deftly navigates his hero through a veritable circus of gods, demons, mythological, and mystical beings of every stripe.While both the Dresden Files and the Iron Druid Chronicles both feature magical male leads it is there the similarities end. Butcher’s works are strongly grounded in the Chicago area; the city has become as much a character as the titular wizard. The Iron Druid Chronicles takes place in Tempe, Arizona; a city with a population equal to just about 5% of Dresden’s Chicago. As a result the novel has a more small town vibe, especially as Atticus bikes back and forth to his New Age bookstore. Given that Atticus is a druid the novel places less emphasis on the urban aspects and far more on the diverse natural landscape of the Arizona desert.Hounded as a wonderful, cavalier anything goes approach to the magical. Over the course of the novel Atticus is visited by about five separate deities, deals with a coven of witches, has a team of lawyers that is one part viking werewolf and one part vampire, fights giants and demons, and somewhere manages to have the time to have a spot of whiskey with his widowed neighbor. Atticus is bonded to an Irish Wolfhound named Oberon and their companionship provides an important aspect of the story and is one of the primary avenues for humor in the novel. As Atticus himself states in the novel it’s Oberon’s innocence and constant sense of wonder that keeps the ancient druid grounded in the here and now.Hounded is a delightfully unpredictable novel that manages to keep both characters and readers guessing what will happen next. With all of the different magical bits crammed in the novel, including occasionally different mythologies, there is still a cohesive feel to everything. Indeed the novel prevents a robust and exciting world that I’m excited to see explored further. Believing that there doesn’t seem to be anything off limits for Hearne is refreshing and discovering how he weaves the various creatures and beings into the story is exciting and never less than entertaining. If you’re tired of the dark and dreary urban fantasies of the world you should definitely give the sun (and occasionally blood) drenched world of Hounded a shot."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.149792"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.149792"]]

Aunque antes de hacer acto de presencia, enviará un montón de problemas en forma de brujas, dioses cabreados y gigantes para que Atticus y su fiel compañero Oberon, un lebrel irlandés, se empleen a fondo.A favor del libro diré que los diálogos están salpicados de humor e ironía pero que a mi personalmente no me han hecho ni fú ni fá. Y lo que más llama la atención es la aparición de la mitología celta que es algo que no se lee todos los días y que el autor usa a manos llenas.En contra, tuve que soportar una narrativa acelerada y pésima con tramas sencillas y bastante \"patateras\", donde Hearne da por hecho que el lector no necesita complicarse la vida con pensamientos y sentimientos de ninguna clase (pa qué) haciendo que los personajes parezcan robots o playmobils.Con frase o frase y media el autor responde a algunas de las interrogantes que aparecen durante la historia dejando la mayor parte sin definir. Y no es que me queje de respuestas escuetas sino del contenido que me dejó a cuadros. En otros libros del género, por poner un ejemplo, vivir indefinidamente conlleva muchísimos problemas e incluso se crean tramas interesantes a partir de ahí, pero en este novela, Hearne pasa de todo y no presta atención a esos detalles que suelen enriquecer las historias.Parece ser que está más cómodo contando batallitas (y encima tampoco es ninguna eminencia porque son de risa) que mimar los detalles a la hora de solucionar las consecuencias de las mismas.Sobre todo actitudes de ciertos personajes en ciertas escenas que me parecen forzadas es lo que me ha hecho darle tan pocas estrellas.(view spoiler)[ Que una vieja alcohólica dé por bueno que se monte una carnicería en su jardín o que a una camarera le parezca de p.. madre que una diosa india use su cuerpo cada vez que le da la gana, lo siento pero no me lo trago (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.180704"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.180704"]]

I think Sandman did it best, but Gaiman's reprisal with American Gods was also good. Thus I was excited to check out this trilogy.Hounded, the first book, was a breezy book, entertaining enough, but its flaws grew as the series continued. The second and third book felt padded and stretched. With better writing and editing, they could (should) have been one book. This was made even more clear when a bevy of new characters showed up and told their stories. It worked for Chaucer, but felt out of place and forced here.The pacing isn't enough to sink this ship, however. The main problem I have with the series is the utter difficulty in believing Atticus. It's fine to have a 2000-year old being, but he should act like he isn't just another guy. Connor Mcleod, for instance, (a similar character) is kind of odd and still in his heart a Highlander.There was nary a page that didn't break the narrative flow with some poor prose or unbelievable situation. There are more examples than I can list, but here are some of the flaws.A running gag is that Atticus (and the Widow) hate the British. The terminology is sloppy. The British include the Welsh and the Scots, and no one hates the Welsh. What Atticus means is that he hates the English. But even this attitude is anachronistic. Atticus is from a non-united Ireland, centuries before it, or England, was a country. If Atticus has a loyalty, it would presumably be to one of the five counties of Ireland.Atticus frequently sounds like Kevin Hearne talking to us. His many cultural references are hard-to-believe and will date the books something fierce within the next 10 years. Worst of all, at least in my opinion, is when he talks of \"squeeing\" from meeting Neil Gaiman. This is shoddy character-building.He's also way too uptight to have been an ancient Celt. Though he \"cavorts\" with Goddesses, attractive women make him act more like Cliff Clavin than a man who lived for two millenia. He is traumatized from seeing two Giants \"cavorting.\" Though he is an ancient Celt, he is more excited to meet Jesus than the gods of his (or any other) pantheon.Some of the worst writing is when he teaches an ancient vampire how to speak in slang. Poorly conceived, it's embarrassing to read.Equally bad, Atticus and several other dieties/demigods/super powerful beings, all of whom are at least 100 years-old, act as homophobic as high-school boys. None of them are originally American, but all of them share the same thought at one point: \"does this make me look gay?\"Hearne is frequently the anti-Chekov. He solves many of the problems with an element he introduces in that very scene. I would have to go into some major spoilers to elaborate, but it's something that happens far too frequently. The scale of things are quite strange as well: a werewolf or a vampire is as strong as a god. Though I finished the trilogy, they have become the worst books I've ever finished. Again, the idea, the set-up, is interesting. But the execution is just horribly inept. I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.184091"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.184091"]]

By about two millennia. But that hasn't stopped him from trying to lead a 'normal' life in Tempe Arizona.Unfortunately, when a human, and a Druid no less, has lived for 2000+ years one is bound to make some enemies, and his archenemy is none other than the Irish god of love Aenghus Óg. For a god of love he's actually a pretty nasty guy.A while back—a long while back—Attitus got his hands on the magical sword Fragarach from one of Aenghus' military generals. The god has been trying to get it back ever since; he's been sending his minions to do his dirty work, and Atticus has been doing a pretty good job avoiding trouble. But now Aenghus is finally coming to finish the job himself.The first thing you'll notice in HOUNDED by Kevin Hearne is Atticus' first person narrative: it's quick-witted, clever, and (this is important) not cliché. Life can get a little crazy for Atticus, with gods trying to kill him, but fortunately he's got a sense of humor. His repartee with his Irish wolfhound Oberon was pretty hilarious, and it proves to be an interesting relationship beyond sidekick/comic relief. The humor was a little too nerdy sometimes, with all of its pop culture references mixed with mythology and old jargon, but that's a minor complaint.The first couple of pages sets up our hero Atticus and the kind of guy he is...and then leaps right into the story. He's attacked outside his store by a group of Fae sent by Aenghus. We get to see what this Druid can do, what his brand of magic means, and how he uses it to preserve his life. From there on out the tightly written plot flows quickly, moving forward without a single hiccup. He uses his magic in realistic ways, with its own limits. Hearne handles that little bit of world-building rather well, considering the short amount of time he has to explain it. He's done his homework and integrates it fluidly into a compelling story.This is present-day U.S., but where there are vampires, werewolves, and witches—and where gods of every pantheon exist (if I had to guess an influence, it would be Gaiman's AMERICAN GODS). Some of them still dabble in human affairs. Some of them even have a great deal of power at their disposal. Take for instance the Morrigan, the Celtic Chooser of the Slain and goddess of war, who's made a deal with Atticus to let him live as long as he continues to irk Aenghus, whom she doesn't much like. In order for Atticus to survive he has to know not only how to fight and use his magic, but also how to keep as many people on his side as possible, even if it means schmoozing.

I think it could very well be my favourite urban fantasy of the year so far. It's strange I tend to often stick to female lead characters in my books, but after reading 'Hounded' I think that's probably very shortsighted of me.Atticus is a Druid, don't be fooled be his youthful appearance. He's not in fact 21, but 2100 years old. But Atticus hasn't survived this long by being the toughest and baddest around, no Atticus has lived this long by being very, very clever.Unfortunately Atticus has also upset an ancient celtic God and been on the run from him for most of this time too, hiding a very powerful and dangerous sword from him. And it looks like Atticus's time may just about be up.This book is so well written, it's pacy, imaginative, but best of all it's packed full of fantastic dry wit. Sometimes the wit is quite subtle and it sneakily catches up on you, causing a belated chortle. In fact overall this book is absolutely hilarious. It's shame I listened to it as an audio books otherwise I could quote some stunning one-liners to you.Atticus is a great hero, while he is powerful, it was his cunning and intelligence that really made me like him, as he manoeuvred through situations through brain not brawn. But equally important is just how cool he is, the kind of coolness that comes about without that person even trying.I also have to mention Atticus's awesome sidekick, Oberon the Irish Wolfhound. Who can communicate with Atticus mind to mind, which is handy as he can share with Atticus his obsession with French poodles and his dream of becoming like Genghis Khan. His latest hero of choice. And of course I mustn't forget the sausages!Humour aside there also some superb action scenes, sword fights ahoy! Showing while he can be clever, Atticus can also kick some serious butt when required. The characters of this book are well thought out, mixing Irish myth into the story. As well as Irish Gods, you've got werewolves, vampires and witches. Plenty of supernatural species to keep you busy.The narrator of this book was Luke Daniels, I've listened to a couple of books narrated by him and he is fast becoming one of my favourite audio narrators. He totally sucks you into the story and grasps the essence of the character he is portraying. Making this a really entertaining audiobook.VERDICTQuite frankly I defy you not to like 'Hounded'. It is without a doubt being added to my favourite urban fantasy book list. And I shall be purchasing the subsequent instalments very, very soon. If you love urban fantasy, it's a must-read."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.194861"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.194861"]]

I know, I know, books aren't supposed to be geared at a specific gender but this is the second book I've read recently where I felt I wasn't the intended audience (Storm Front being the other one). This is basically Die Hard with magic - and while I sometimes like a story with lots of brawn and shiny weapons, I'm not sure about this one.Atticus is a druid who looks like a hot Irish guy in his early twenties. He has the ability to draw power from the earth, he's actually 2000 years old, and has managed to piss off a really old god by stealing from him. He is now in possession of *start breathy, sultry female voice* a really big, powerful sword *end breathy, sultry female voice* and has to protect both it and himself from said god (and a coven of vindictive witches).Before he actually meets the god, he sleeps with one goddes, kisses two other goddesses (all of whom are drop-dead gorgeous), and manages to get a really attractive female apprentice. His powers are nearly inexhaustible and he has a (debatable) sense of humor (WAY too many dated pop-culture references). Do you se where I'm going with this? Atticus can do everything. He can also be something of an asshole sometimes. Well, I like my heroes more nuanced. I like them flawed and sometimes weak. But hey, if cocky guys float your boat, you've hit gold (mixing my metaphors here, I know).I also have a complaint to make about female roles here - the witches are supremely bithcy, the goddesses manipulative and heartless (and terribly vain at the same time), and they all exist to worship the ground Atticus walks upon. Meh.The story is not without its redeeming qualities, however. I really, really liked the supporting cast: Oberon the dog with whom Atticus can speak through a mind link; the old Irish widow, Mrs. MacDonagh, who doesn't even bat an eye when she sees Atticus kill a man in her yard because he assures her he was British; the weird Indian witch inhabiting the body of a buxom barmaid.And as much as I rolled my eyes at Atticus's attempts at making jokes (mostly he just thinks them and amuses himself), I quite liked some of them: \"Isn't the Christian god prominent here?\" - \"The Christians have such muddled ideas of him that he usually can't take shape beyond the crucifix form, so he rarely bothers. Mary will appear more often, though, and she can do some pretty awesome stuff if she feels like it. Mostly she sits around looking beatific and full of grace. Keeps calling me 'child', even though I'm older than she is.\"All in all, the story is fast-paced, I liked the setting, and most of the characters are decent."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.197553"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.197553"]]

Atticus is the only remaining Druid from a time long gone by, hiding out from Angus Og, the Celtic god of love and youth, who wants to kill Atticus for a perceived wrong-doing. In Atticus’s world, every deity, Fae, witch, and paranormal creature is very real. Posing as a twenty-something new-age bookstore owner, Atticus has remained hidden in the East Valley/Tempe region of Arizona. However, powerful Fae are playing a game of politics, and Atticus finds himself in the center of their machinations. The Iron Druid Chronicles were recommended to me by a couple of my urban fantasy-audiobook friends, and I am happy to report that so far, it’s a winner. Although I was expecting something along the lines of either the Mercy Thompson series or the Dresden Files, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a unique and interesting mythology. This first offering, Hounded, serves to develop the extremely detailed mythology and introduce what I assume with be the key players throughout the series. The primary focus of the story is the impending battle between Angus Og and Atticus, with each step serving to share more of the Iron Druid’s world. Although I would have like a little bit stronger story, the fresh and unique mythology kept me more than interested in the tale. Additionally, I enjoyed Googling the different Celtic deities to find out more about each and add that knowledge to the context of the story.The story (and series) is read by Luke Daniels, a new-to-me narrator. Overall, I felt he did a solid job. His performance as the narrator/Atticus is spot on; a youthful voice, tempered by years of knowledge and wisdom. I also found his voice for Atticus’s more-than-a-dog, Oberon, perfect with a gruffness one would expect from a dog that can (mentally) speak. Sometimes I found Atticus a bit too calm, but not negatively so. Daniels has a nice range for both female and male, human and non-human characters. Overall, Hounded is a good start to an interesting UF series. I enjoyed the world development and character interaction. I really liked Atticus: a mix of wiseman, impish boy, full of courage and charm. I loved his relationship with Oberon, although sometimes it's like a father-child relationship, which made a scene at the close of the book a bit weird for me. The political machinations of the Fae were intriguing, but I hope for more story in the following books now that the world is established.

This caused an eyebrow raise, being as the praise essentially combined two of my favorite authors' work into an impossible-to-meet expectation of awesomeness. As a result of this (I'm pretty certain), I felt a bit let down by this book. It wasn't bad, not by a long shot, but how could anything actually live up to that kind of a cover blurb? Honestly, it's just setting people up for disappointment.The characters were ok. Atticus, as a main character, was drawn fairly two-dimensionally. For a man who's lived for millenia, he just didn't have much going for him except for a strong libido and a dog who was funnier than he was by a mile. Female characters were barely drawn, except as objects of the aforementioned libido. There is no way this book would pass the Bechdel test. The other male characters weren't terribly detailed, either.As for the plot, again it wasn't terrible. It also did actually remind me of the Dresden Files a bit in the sense that Atticus seemed pulled around and manipulated by those more powerful than he. A lot. At least he occasionally got the chance to rest and recharge, unlike poor Harry.The setting was pretty standard. Witches, werewolves, vampires, druids, etc. are all in the world but the mundanes don't know they exist. Nothing new there. The only thing that struck me as somewhat different was the idea that all gods from all pantheons exist in the world. Apparently this is the bit they were comparing to American Gods in the blurb. One of the items I found most amusing in the story was that all gods could manifest, except Jesus had issues with doing so because of the inconsistency in the beliefs of his various worshipers. He couldn't pick a form, whereas the pagan gods are looked at pretty universally consistently by everyone. And everyone apparently hates Thor. Though why, we are not told.Overall, I just don't know. There were bits of this book that amused me, and it wasn't terrible, but nor was it great. It was billed as \"laugh-out-loud\" funny. I didn't see it. If I hit a dry spell, I might look up the others in this series at the library. Who knows, the later books could be better.

That isn't necessarily an indicator of how I judge the quality of this novel, but at the same time, I started listening to it the first week of August and I finished it this past weekend. That isn't a sign of enthusiasm.I think this is how I've felt about every non-Dresden Files Urban Fantasy novel I've read, well, ever. It's like people say that love isn't the sort of thing you run out of, or don't have room for, but for me, I think Dresden has all my love for this genre and I can't muster anything up for anyone else. All I could think about while reading (listening) was how much this was basically a re-written Dresden novel. That isn't a bad thing, I guess, it's just that, I don't know, I guess I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to actually enjoy things. I'm forced to think that the number of supernatural creatures and beings most likely outnumber the mundane given how nearly every character presented in this story is a Fae, god, werewolf, vampire, witch, demon, sentient dog, or immortal druid. Sweet Jeebus! Just give me a regular human or two, just for my sanity. These characters all have different abilities and temperaments which I guess is interesting. It just wore me out. I probably wasn't in the mood for it and have little to no interest in the world this story takes place in. That said, I think this was the author's first novel, and as such, I really thought it was well done. It got to the point of things, had passages I felt were well compellingly written, and wasn't unnecessarily long. Basically, if someone from my writer's group turned this in for critique, I would have shit myself in praise for the work, it's only when compared to the best of the best that it fall short... and of course, my growing dissatisfaction with the genre in general. So, you know, it's fine. If you love the genre and can't get enough of it, I think it's better than other series I've read. If this is your sort of thing, I feel like you'd really enjoy this. Not really for me though. Oh, and just in case some future historian is curious, this is not the book I was referring to in my previous review that was a huge tome that was taking me forever to get through. I sorta forgot I was listening to this when I wrote that review. That review is probably going to be next. Assuming I ever finish the book.

In many ways, it feels like the author was aspiring to follow in the footsteps of Jim Butcher, but the result is certainly no Dresden Files.Hounded is a first-person story following a +2000-year-old Irish Druid, Atticus O'Sullivan, living in modern day Arizona. It suffers from a series of significant flaws, including: lack of tension, unfunny protagonist attempting to be funny and eye-rollingly perfect life (for him, anyway) that is not impeded once during the story.The plot revolves around an old enemy of Atticus', who wants back an ancient magical sword that the Druid came into possession of centuries ago. Given that this old enemy is a god, an actual legitimate deity of the old Irish-Celtic pantheon, I am almost impressed that the author managed to write a story where the protagonist effortlessly coasts through without seeming to strain himself or be at any risk. We wouldn't want to create a sense of tension now, would we?Character development is also completely absent. Though this may be inevitable given that Atticus pre-dates the birth of Jesus of Nazareth and still, after all this time, comes off as less mature than any given teenage boy in high school.There is nothing wrong with a protagonist that is fun-loving to the point of geekish behaviour, but if you're going for believable characters it needs to be balanced against what they spend their time doing and what they've been through. Someone whose birthdate includes the initials 'BC' and lived through several lifetimes worth of wars and battles must by no means be grim or old-fashioned, but I refuse to accept that they'd be tossing off geek references like 'frakking cylons' at covens of witches because they delight in getting the obscure joke that their peers neither understand nor care about.I would love to give this book a 1.5 stars, but unfortunately Goodreads refuses to allow much clarity in it's ranking scheme. I have decided to fall on a single star instead of two, because although the concept of an essentially immortal Druid living in the modern day and crossing paths with supernatural and mythical figures is incredibly interesting, I do not think a single interesting concept is enough to earn an entire story a greater rank in overall quality.

There were times when the story lagged, but just slightly. Overall the pacing was great, the tension and suspense high, and my investment in the characters didn't waver. The hilarious one lines were a big help with all of this, and most of them went to the dog. For instance...Atticus-\"You hear that? The nice blond lady in her thirties is actualy more than 140 years old.\" Oberon- \"She must use that oil of Olay stuff. I wonder if it would get rid if the wrinkles on a shar-pei?\" \"You have no idea how bitchy werewolves can be.\" After defeating the big bad guy - \"All right, that's over.

That's how much I didn't mind going past the first book, because hell, I loved it!Atticus O'Sullivan (because right now I would not be able to spell his full name even if I tried) is the last Druid standing, living as a perpetual 21-year-old bookshop owner in Arizona. Acclimated to his modern day environment, this 2000-year-old Druid is living quite a lifestyle: handsome Irish youth during the day, shapeshifting wolfhound during the night, occasional sparring partner and midnight snack for a vampire lawyer, and lover of goddesses somewhere in between (or, really, when the moment takes them, that lucky bastard...). But clearly nothing is as clear-cut and shiny when he has a Celtic god gunning after him, all because he owns one of those awesomely cool god-killing swords. Oh, and there are Icelandic werewolves and vampires, Slavic and Indian witches, and mentions of other cultural gods and beliefs. Yeah.I don't think I have laughed as often or lost my shit as often as I have in Hounded for quite some time. There were clearly a ton of gems in the book, and a number of hilarity in the characters. That said, I am also a sucker for mythology, so the fact that there was a lot regarding the Celtic myths here made it ever more fabulous. The Tuatha De Danann and the smatterings of other pantheons were fabulously relayed and displayed. The constant pop culture references made me chortle often--and this is a lot, because I swear I got/understood most--if not all--of them (I must have died at \"frakkin' Cylon\" and then again at the Quentin Tarantino reference). Oberon was just like his owner, funny and charming and all sorts of batshit crazy. The Morrigan is my new favorite of the Tuatha De (although she does constantly get pushed down by Brighid, but don't tell her that...). Oh, and I swear the entire time I was reading the book, I was craving a really good serving of fish and chips (and occasionally sausage or steak...darn you, Oberon!).

He spends his days running an occult bookshop in Tempe, Arizona.The plot follows a celtic god; Aenghus Óg who wants to reclaim a powerful Fae sword - Fragarach, Atticus who has the sword in his possession decides to face down with Aenghus once and for all rather than running. It was a fast paced, action packed thrill ride that had me swiftly turning the pages wanting to know more. I loved every moment of it.Hounded has a cast of brilliant paranormal creatures, including vampires, werewolves, Fae, gods and witches and each play an important role in this book – I did feel there were a tad too many and as a result affected the developmental sides of things but I hope we’ll learn more about them in the next book. I especially loved Oberon, his hound who could communicate with him telepathically which I though was great, the dialogue between them at times was hilarious!I rarely read a book that doesn’t contain romance and this book had zilch but I still loved every moment of it. Atticus was such a wonderful, well thought out character and I enjoyed reading a book from a male POV –I also think his sidekick Oberon helped to make this book the awesome read that it was; it was humorous, fun and witty.Mr. Hearne has written a wonderful page turner in Hounded, his characterizations are perfect, the plot was fast paced and flowed perfectly and the writing detailed and entertaining, the world he has created kept me riveted. I am so eager to get started on Hexed, the next book in this enthralling series.Books in order:1. Hounded2. Hexed3. Hammered4. Tricked5. Trapped6.

The first chapter opens up with action and sets up the conflict and while it may have lagged just a little in the action after that for a bit, you get to catch your breath and have a look around at Atticus's world. The action does pick back up again after the reader is well grounded. It was nice and VERY refreshing to read a male POV urban fantasy that wasn't overful of snark and profanity - yet retained that 'male not female' inner voice. I haven't read such a well done male main character since Harry Dresden, so high five to Kevin Hearne!There were a couple of problems that I had with the book, which bumped it down from a 5 star rating for me.1. Atticus is 2000 years old and doesn't feel the need to explain much about how he performs his magic. He just does it. Sometimes, as a reader, this pulled me out of the story because I didn't have any mental pictures from words to paint about how this happens. The action/fight scenes were really well done for me, but the magic, such as him placing a binding on himself or others, is glossed over too much. Those parts didn't feel real and as a result I rather felt more like I was jumping into book 2 of a series, rather than the first when the author is confident that the reader knows from book 1 what most of the magic is like and can give shorter, less elaborate descriptions of the magic performed. I have high hopes that book 2 will expand the readers knowledge of the magic in this world, since circumstances at the end of book 1 will set things up for this to happen. At least IMO.

It's simple, linear, has a strong lead voice and an adorable sidekick - an Irish wolfhound Oberon who has fantastic sense of humor.Atticus, who looks like an attractive 21 year-old Irish lad in reality is 2100 year-old Druid. Centuries ago he stole an powerful sword from A Celtic god of love, who, let's say, is not a well liked figure among the rest of the Celtic pantheon. To spite him Morrigan, the goddess of battle and war swore not to take Atticus life, and thus he is still alive and running from the vengeful god and his flunkies.But our Druid is fed up with running, he's got a nice new age shop, couple of friends - a werewolf and a vampire, who coincidentally serve as his lawyers and sparring partners, and a wonderful loyal dog who he taught to speak with him telepathically. So whatever comes next, he is staying.What follows is a fascinating roller coaster of events, with spiteful witches, horny goddesses and one pissed off ghost...I absolutely loved it. There is simple logic and purity in this book, wonderful kindness and humor despite the brutal battles which Atticus has to participate in. It's, for the lack of better word, earthy. Atticus is cautious, diplomatic and cunning, just what you expect from someone who lived for that long, and his dog... You have to listen to their conversations! “You will respect my authori-tah!\" Oberon said, in a passable imitation of Eric Cartman. I reminded him that I needed to concentrate.

I've been reading Peter F. Hamilton and Ernest Cline and James S.A. Corey and William Gibson and Patrick Rothfuss and George R.R.

They have context, complex thoughts, motivations, qualities, flaws, all the things you can identify with. I identified with very many characters lately but not with Atticus -- the main character of this book.Hounded, I'm sorry to say, is not good. It's not that the story is bad (a 2100 year old Druid in modern america, how awesome does that sound?), it has a lot of potential. It's just that, well, the writing isn't up to my \"standards\" now.The whole book is written in first-person, seen through the eyes of Atticus, and it is flat. I read the entire thing and never once did I identify with the character. I mean, I wanted to identify with the main character, I really did, but the writing kept me from it. More than once I found myself silently yelling at the book as exposition that just started getting good suddenly moves on to something else. Never once did I feel scared or worried or excited for the main character. He was completely flat, two-dimensional, mechanically doing the predictable and I couldn't identify with him. Sadly, the only reason for that is the writing.I don't want to sound elitist, I have mad respect for Kevin Hearne: writing and publishing a book is not something that just anybody can do and I, for one, could not do it. I don't pretend to believe I could write this book better than he could -- because I couldn't.

Atticus has a great deal of power which he draws from the earth and has studied magic for centuries which has enabled him to stay alive. It does appear quite a few very powerful entities want him dead. Told in the first person, Atticus is funny, clever and witty and then there is his dog. Oberon is an Irish Wolf Hound who through some magic spells can communicate with his master using telepathy. Oberon has as good a sense of humor as Atticus so their banter is just great.Did I mention witches and werewolves. There are some good and some very bad witches involved in the story and Atticus's attornies are - werewolves. A doctor who does some work on him after a very bad fight is also part of the pack. Adding to the humor and revealing a little of our Druid's soft side is his neighbor, an elderly Irish lady whose yard he takes care of for her. Their interaction is funny and sweet too.Okay, I admit there is just no way to explain this book, so just read it if you want a fun and interesting trip pulling ancient Celtic Gods into modern day Arizona. You will laugh but you will also have some tense moments, because these guys play serious and it's not all fun and games. There are swordfights and magic flying back and forth.

In many others, the book as an entirety already is fading from my mind. The latter is to blame mostly. That cannot be helped. But I'd like to articulate what earned this book four stars. The first thing is that the writer kept things interesting while making his hero near invincible. The logistics of living in the modern world and what being a Druid in a secular (or not so secular, considering the shop our hero owns) society make for an absorbing perusal. Usually I don't think action translates well to literature. The author...knows this. In the climax most of the battle is implied. I had fun reading the names and powers of the Irish gods. I know that Thor will appear at some point in the future books and I'm anticipating that. The cover art is well done. I would never imagine a Druid so young an so suburban. Granuaile could have been irritating but doesn't come across as a brat. All these nice cajoles and nifty touches is the result of the author being as careful as his hero is paranoid. I feel that the writer knows what works from reading about past and lesser fantasy books. There are some characters that are memorable, and all of them are clear cut. One of them, the Irish widow, is superfluous. I think the author realized he was making Atticus too unlikable. The clumsiness in the manipulation for our sympathy is resounding. I think that character could be dispensed with without losing anything. I did find Atticus a bit callous but then not so much. Atticus only once showed a mellow side, and that was regarding the death of the detective. At other times, he is tempted, trapped, hounded indeed. The few days narrated in the book is very hectic for our endangered hero and the result is brisk storytelling.

He's a laid back, witty and earthy (that will be the Druidy bit) guy who likes the ladies (well Goddesses mostly) and has a favourite Irish pub. I loved the fact that despite being 1,200 years old Atticus is not anything like these ancient stuffy vampires I usually read about who still speak and act like they did when they became vampires. Atticus has adapted to the modern world and is pretty up to date but can still throw in a little story about Shakespear for effect. (he gets excellent name dropping points from me). His side kick Oberon is an adorable hilarious Irish Wolfhound who speaks to him telepathically about his dog like obsession with Genghis Khan and finding himself some French poodle action.Not only is Atticus being hunted by a Fae God for his magical sword, he's got some mean Polish witches on his back and various Gods and Goddesses after him- it's not always clear to Atticus (or to the reader) who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. There are fight scenes galore and Celtic and Norse mythology but not too much that it becomes a history lesson.

The dude is all sorts of awesome. He has tattoos that help him draw on the power of the earth. He fights dirty when he needs to. He loves his dog. He spends time with old ladies because he knows what it's like to outlive your friends and family. Awwwww. I LIKE this guy! His snark makes me laugh. And somehow SOMEHOW he manages to not piss of some seriously powerful gods who take offense at the most innocuous of things. He's the guy we all hope to be when we hit the two thousand year mark. Or maybe that's just me.I really, really got a kick out of every part of this book. From how all the werewolves hate Thor for his douchebaggery to Oberon's quest for sausages, it made me laugh. I'm a little sad that I don't have book 2 in my hands right this very minute.I guess I'll just have to channel Atticus and show a little patience. Well, either that or go cut someone in half with my badass enchanted sword. Oh, man.

Meanwhile, Atticus becomes very good at staying alive...Hearne was able to mix mythology and ancient concepts with the modern era in a quirky and very enjoyable way. He brought in werewolves, vampires, and witches without becoming all \"Twilight-y\", the depictions of the various creatures were gritty and pretty scary.I loved Hearne's depiction of the druid religion. Atticus isn't just some dude in a robe. He's an earth-bound warrior priest who can change his shape and do all sorts of other awesome earth magic type things. He can also converse with his dog, which provided some great comic relief and some of my favorite exchanges.Hearne introduces multiple pantheons of gods into this world so the possibilities that this series can explore are very broad, which is exciting. He also made the followers of the different gods totally unique so, for example, Atticus doesn't understand how the witches do magic, he just knows that they can. Not knowing what the enemy can do makes the action so much more tense!The pace of this novel was gripping. There wasn't really a down moment. It was action all the way, which was great fun to read and made it hard to put the book down. I lost some sleep time to this amazing page turner.I am definitely reading more of this series.

As the story unfolded Hearne built a fascinating and unique world that brought many smiles to my face.

What carries this story however is the incredible wit that is wielded by Hearne. The pop culture references throughout made me chuckle, and the dialogue had me having to put the book down at times to just have a good laugh! Attitcus is genuinely funny, and his interaction with his wolfhound is truly how I would imagine a conversation with my dog would unfold!

(June 1, 2012)On the surface, this seems like any other urban fantasy book I've read and loved. But really, it's one of the most unique books I've ever read.And let me just say, I loved it.Honestly, it was refreshing to read a book in this genre written by a man with a male main character. That almost never happens! At least, not in the circles I tend to stay in.Atticus is a fun dude. I love to listen to him talk. He's very formal in his narration (no contractions, even) but he knows how important speech is to fitting into the community (so that his 2000+ years don't arouse suspicion ) and is able to converse in the vernacular. I love it.Even though Atticus is the main character, he is not my favorite character. My favorite character in the series is his dog Oberon. Yes, you read that right, his dog. As a druid, Atticus has the ability to bind himself to his pet and teach him to talk in his mind. The two converse telepathically. And Oberon is just awesome.He may actually be my all time favorite character ever.Even if you don't think you'll like reading about the last remaining druid in a world where all of the gods of all of the pantheons are (or were) real (not to mention werewolves, vampires, and witches)... read it anyway (well truly, I recommend the audiobook).

The world and the scope was also very limited, with most events occurring in less than a handful of settings.

Excellent representations that feel true to the mythology, but also ground them in our world so that we can see the contrast. The gods are neither bumbling idiots nor without their own collection of faults.On top of the pantheon of gods causing trouble, we have werewolf attorneys, a coniving coven of witches, and ghouls with a refrigerator truck. Love the world built here. Very simple mechanics, but real thought goes into each element added.Despite the good world, though, I had trouble enjoying this book. I just couldn't bring myself to care about Atticus. He's not a terrible character, but not one I empathized with well and perhaps too overpowered. Other characters were excellent and I've read books purely for the secondaries before, but this book was so dominated by Atticus that I had trouble doing even that. Perhaps if this book weren't in first, but limited third instead...I may give the second book a shot.

When Atticus O’Sullivan is tells people he is 21 they think years, he means centuries. Atticus is just the first of a large cast of wonderful characters. There is a very angry Celtic god that wants a sword belonging to Atticus, a goddess of death, a vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a sexy bartender who shares her body with a Hindu witch and best of all is Oberon, Atticus’s Irish wolfhound, a dog that can communicate.Filled with well-developed characters, a great story line, and fast paced action Hounded kept me reading.

Atticus' relationship with his wolfhound Oberon and his elderly neighbor Mrs. MacDonagh help to humanize this very powerful magic user.

It was easy, funny, a quick read, and pretty interesting.To me the biggest selling points are the humor and the background information on the various deities.  I don't usually laugh out loud during a reading, and I did catch myself chuckling aloud from time to time.  I also appreciated the amount of research that went into the book, as it's obvious Mr. Hearne knows quite a bit about his subject matter, so in that respect I feel like I learned a few things, which was great.  The book was also very creative!I have one major piece of criticism, but unfortunately for me it brought down the total score quite a bit.  The book is unevenly written.  Humor, written to great effect in some places, simply doesn't work in others, resulting in an uneven understanding of some of the main characters.  For instance, the protagonist has a talking dog.  The dog is hilarious, at times, but in others his humor seems out of place or unlikely (I recognize that this is a talking dog, so all bets are out the window.  But everyone knows what dogs are like, and even a really well-read, smart, funny dog is, well, a dog.  I think the character would have been more likeable/believable if he was more like a dog, less like a comedian.  Look at the dog from  Up!   Perfectly written talking dog!!).  The dog's humor - and the protagonist's - is often misplaced, serving only to drain the tension from a scene.  Indeed, throughout the book there's constant attempts at humor (many of which work, to varying degrees, which is great), but this humor often ruins the tension and drama, ingredients essential to a great story.Another problem I had with the book is that the author doesn't do a particularly successful job building up characters or helping the reader achieve a true understanding of them.  Some of the main characters (the main antagonist and his witch sidekick, for instance), are brought up throughout the book as main characters, and yet, they're only sketchily drawn when we finally see them (both their personalities and their descriptions).  Because of this, by the time the final showdown occurs I really didn't feel all that connected to the good guys, or feel much antagonism for the bad guys.  Things just sort of happened, without any emotional repercussions.When you get down to it, I couldn't shake the feeling that throughout the book the author was so set on making jokes that the plot itself suffered.  I don't think that needs to be the case.In conclusion, this is a good book, it really is, but because I came away from it feeling little connection to the characters or plot, I simply wasn't invested in getting the sequel."], ["platform", "Amazon"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.367231"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.367231"]]

He also throws in other supernaturals like vampires, witches, werewolves and demons.However the book is a pretty light, superficial read. There is no depth of character, everything feels pretty one-dimensional and the graphical descriptions I found somewhat lacking. If he is such a dangerous enemy, I'd have hoped for a little bit more arse-kicking in the fight scenes (the description does promise good arse-kicking).In addition scenes involving sexual interests (I'll be vague here as to not accidentally spoil anything) are pretty juvenile. Basically someone gets naked and he gets interested and can't help himself, and then cut scene. It really feels like a book for young adults.I read the intro for the second book, if I get in the mood I may read it.I'd recommend this book for someone who likes urban fantasy and is in the mood for some really superficial light entertainment."], ["platform", "Amazon"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998m/9533378.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.374528"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:11:48.374528"]]

So they have to twist the story or the underlying logic of the way magic works in that world or even the basic reality of that world--or all of the above--to make everything work out. If you know how to tell a good tale, you really don't have to do all that. It is sort of silly to set up these uber-powerful heroes and then have to figure out ways to make it so they can't or won't use all that power in various situations. Again, not necessary...if they have an information deficit, you can make the story work even if they have oodles of power. Now, notwithstanding all that, I still like all those books, to varying degrees.Hounded is not like those books...at least, the first book isn't. Hearne knows how to spin a tale, and he can create some truly funny moments. Although it may also be that I have the same sort of immature sense of humor that Atticus shows from time to time. So, yes, as we move through the subsequent books, we start heading into familiar territory, where the challenges seem a bit much. Nevertheless, the books remain really well written and the stories are well-crafted. The characters show some deep thought, and the plots can make you think about some things, but nothing overwhelming or a slap in the face. Truly interesting world creation, or perhaps more accurately, adaptation of Irish, Norse, and other folklore.I don't bother reviewing plots and such. Read the book for that. The upshot here is, why 5 stars? Because I couldn't put these books down--any of them.

It combines ancient myth with modern times. Our 2100 year old Druid, Atticus O'Sullivan, living in Arizona has been hounded by Aenghus Og a powerful figure from Irish mythology for centuries. Atticus who is a handsome Irish guy appearing to be 21 who owns an occult book store, has a magic sword that Aenghus Og intends to take from him. Atticus has an interesting array of \"maybe\" friends including The Morrigan who is a seductive Goddess of death who can turn into a crow at will. Atticus has a great deal of power which he draws from the earth and has studied magic for centuries which has enabled him to stay alive. It does appear quite a few very powerful entities want him dead. Told in the first person, Atticus is funny, clever and witty and then there is his dog. Oberon is an Irish Wolf Hound who through some magic spells can communicate with his master using telepathy. Oberon has as good a sense of humor as Atticus so their banter is just great.Did I mention witches and werewolves. There are some good and some very bad witches involved in the story and Atticus's attornies are - werewolves and a vampire. A doctor who does some work on him after a very bad fight is also part of the pack. Adding to the humor and revealing a little of our Druid's soft side is his neighbor, an elderly Irish lady whose yard he takes care of for her. Their interaction is funny and sweet too.Okay, I admit there is just no way to explain this book, so just read it if you want a fun and interesting trip pulling ancient Celtic Gods into modern day Arizona. You will laugh but you will also have some tense moments, because these guys play serious and it's not all fun and games. There are swordfights and magic flying back and forth. There is no romance in this book but I suspect there is to be some in the next book.

In fact, the ease with which he allows the reader to slip into Atticus's world makes this seem like it's not even the first in a series.\"Hounded\" blends a lot of the old tropes in a new and dynamic way and Hearne does this without boring the reader with tons of exposition nor assuming that one would be familiar with all the name-dropping that occurs. Instead, Atticus doles out the necessary backstory and legends as needed with a snarky wit that manages to make all the history lessons accessible without dumbing them down.The surprising thing for me was how quickly things started off. At first, from what Atticus explains of his life and how determined he is to stay off the radar of the Fae, I expected that everything would be dragged out slowly and painfully. But just when that seems to be the case things ratchet into high gear. Though, Atticus does his best to not play along for the majority of the book and in fact only shows some active initiative in driving the plot when there is no other choice. All this is understandable and very well developed throughout the book, but it's not only Atticus who was a bit ruffled by the fact so much of what occurred to propel him forward was masterminded by others. In a world where every imaginable deity exists I suppose this is only to be expected, but it didn't really sit right for me and I'm curious to see if in future books Atticus remains as irked about it all as I am.The subplots are usually the more ignorable parts of a story for me and when they aren't it's usually speaks to how weak the main plot is. However, I rather enjoyed the lighter side of this novel and I can credit all of that to Oberon who is absolutely adorable and endearing. I don't know if it was just a Kindle thing, though that had all his \"dialogue\" be in less and greater than symbols, but I found it sort of jarring to read and not the best method of denoting his thoughts. I also liked that he wasn't just comic relief or even merely a sidekick, but a true companion for Atticus. The fact that he ends up in the damsel in distress role towards the end of the book seems a bit off in an amusing way, but Hearne manages to make it work without being overly cheesy.Essentially, this was a quick, fun, whirlwind of a read and my interest is certainly piqued for further adventures in Atticus's world.

When I found this series I suggested it to him and he loves it. I finally relented to his hounding (see what I did there?) to start the series myself. And though there were some issues, for the first in a series it was a good start.The best parts of the book are the folklore and world-building.  This isn’t the first series I have come across where “all” gods are real in addition to vampires, witches, werewolves & Fae. But it is the first I’ve come across to show them through the lens of a Druid. His powers are different than the usual in urban fantasy and it makes Atticus a distinctive narrator.  And the cast of supporting characters are colorful and interesting. I want to learn more about them.Where I found the book to be weak was with Atticus – he’s too passive, and in a book without a mystery that’s a problem. Not that he doesn’t fight; he gets attacked many times.  But EVERYTHING comes to him. A succession of gods pop in to conveniently tell him what he needs to know. The entire book is an introduction to the world, and a set-up for a final battle with Aenghus Og.  He doesn’t investigate, or do much preparation, or make any plan until the very end.  This made it very easy for me to put the book down several times because I never felt the *need* to know what would happen next.That said, I did enjoy the world Hearne has created and the possibility of an apprentice for Atticus to work and talk with (besides the dog) shows potential. And the way some of the gods, who do not appear, are described, makes me eager to meet them.  I will definitely read the next book, I just hope Atticus is more proactive in it.

Hounded was a wonderful mix of action, mythology, and humor with great characters throughout.  And I loved the Star Wars references.Hearne's world was well developed and very colorful.  All manner of gods, myths, and creatures walk the world.  There are vampires, werewolves, witches, trolls, elves, deities, and more.  I also love the fact that everyone thinks Thor is an \"asshat\".  It may seem random, but it's little things like that that give character to the world of the Iron Druid Chronicles.  There are good guys and bad guys and guys in between - all well written with believable motivations.The plot moves quickly but is not confusing.  Hearne tells the reader about Atticus' past and his world at a nice pace.  You aren't overwhelmed with information nor are you ready to strangle the author in order to get answers.  He also efficiently introduces and explains the different Celtic deities so I wasn't subjected to pages and pages of description and background for each character.

New York City was passing her by. Bridges and billboards bearing smiling people were passing her by. Skyscrapers and brownstones were rushing by. Fast. Too fast. Forever.\n3 1/2 stars. Ah, this book was a pleasant surprise. I picked Behold the Dreamers for my September Book of the Month read, mostly because none of the others appealed to me. I hadn't any previous plans to read it but, as it happens, it turned out to be an enjoyable read. Full of sadness, hope and - of course - dreamers.It's quite an understated book for the most part. Quiet and character-driven. Set just after the economic crisis of 2007/2008, we see the American Dream from two different perspectives - that of Jende Jonga and his family, Cameroonian immigrants desperately trying to obtain a green card and stay in America, and that of the Edwards family, wealthy upper-class New Yorkers who show the cracks in this idea of paradise held by immigrants.The theme is an old one - the fragility of the American Dream - and yet this Cameroonian family breathe new life into it. The author herself is a Cameroonian immigrant living in the United States, and so is able to weave the Jonga family with firsthand insight and honesty; the result being characters that come to life on the page and make you remember them.There's an undercurrent of sadness to the whole book. Jende is such a wide-eyed, hopeful dreamer who longs to bring his wife and son to a place he considers a land of opportunity. At a time when animosity towards immigrants has been fostered by the likes of Donald Trump, this book really strikes a chord. The Jonga family are distinctly West-African in their ideals and cultural practices, and yet their desire to give their son the best life possible is a heartbreakingly universal one.All of the characters are treated with such love and care by the author. Members of both the Jonga and Edwards families are multi-layered and sensitively portrayed. Cultural differences and issues of privilege are explored - for example, the Edwards' oldest son is anti-establishment and longs to abandon law school and head to India, whereas Jende believes the opportunity to become a lawyer is one of the greatest things he could give his son.It's a painfully realistic book, as all good books about the \"American Dream\" tend to be. Sometimes I wanted a bit more from it - a lot of the story and themes of race/culture are revealed through conversations and the plot itself is very... simple. Though perhaps that is a strength too.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.815150"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.815150"]]

Jende Jonga in efforts to get his green card explains to Clark Edwards, in his interview for a job as chauffeur why he wants to be in America: \"Everyone wants to come to America, sir. Everyone. To be in this country, sir. To live in this country. Ah! It's the greatest thing in the world, Mr.Edwards...Because ...because in my country, sir,\" Jende said ...for you to become somebody, you have to be born somebody first. You do not come from a family with a name, forget it. That is just how it is, sir. Someone like me, what can I ever become in a country like Cameroon? I came from nothing. No name. No money, my father is a poor man. Cameroon has nothing-\"This dream to stay in America for Jende and his wife Neni , a dream to become somebody and have a good life for their children is the center of this story but yet it becomes about a lot more as Jende and Neni's future become so tied to Clark Edwards and his wife Cindy. They get pulled into the personal affairs of Clark and Cindy , become their confessors of sorts , telling their inner most feelings and pasts . Yet Jende and Neni have their own burdens, trying to keep from getting deported and having to use some of their savings to help their family in Cameroon. But then the burdens become greater as they are asked by Clark and Cindy to keep their secrets which they must in order to keep their jobs.So much of making their dream come true is dependent on money and so much of their dream is to have money . The timing of the story taking place as Clark's employer , Lehman goes bankrupt reflects on a larger scale what people will do for money. There are a number of acts of desperation that happen here, making the characters less than likable even though I felt sorry for their helplessness at times.I learned a good bit about the difficulties of immigrant families and the process of trying to stay in this country. I would like to have seen Jende and Neni's story play out without the link to the Lehman bankruptcy. I was surprised at the ending but not sure that it could have gone any other way.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Random House."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.826804"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.826804"]]

Imbolo Mbue has written an illuminating book on the immigrant experience amidst the hollowness of the American dream set in New York. The story is told from the perspectives of Jende Jongo, and his wife, Nemi, who are from Cameroon dreaming of a better future in their new home. They have a son, Liomi, for whom they have high hopes. The stage is set for an exploration of their precarious lives buffeted by economic and social forces beyond their control as the 2008 financial collapse is described in terms of its human cost.Jende is working as a cabbie when he lands the dream job of chauffeur to Lehman's executive, Clark Edward, who demands Jende keeps his secrets and give him his absolute loyalty. The two men become close and Clark's wife, Cindy, gives his wife, Nemi, a job as a housekeeper. Cindy confides her thoughts and secrets to Nemi who is hard working and hoping to become a pharmacist. We are given an in depth insight into the laborious and costly process of trying to acquire a green card. The spectacular collapse of Lehman has enormous repercussions on the Edward family. Clark loses his job and the strain on his marriage results in its collapse. Jende and Nemi find themselves with divided loyalties and caught up in the slipstream of these events, and there is a simultaneous similarity as their future comes under threat. We observe the contrasts between a family of privilege and a family with little and the power dynamic in the relationship between the two. We see the yearnings for home, Cameroon, whilst trying to fit into a new home, the eternal immigrant heart caught between two worlds.The novel perhaps underscores the naivete of the dreams of the immigrant given the harsh reality of the world. Mbue touches on the issues of race, culture, violence, pain, and the impact of male decisionmaking on women. The writing is beautiful at times although the characters and plot feel a little uneven on occasion. However, this takes nothing away from a novel that is a timely and pertinent story that carries an authentic picture of an immigrant experience. The characters of Jende and Nemi are complex and captured my interest easily. I loved the portrayal of their home country and their connections with it. A wonderful and insightful book that I recommend highly. Thanks to HarperCollins 4th Estate for an ARC.

I was actually planning on picking this up closer to its release date, but decided at the last minute to just read a line or two to see if it would work in my favor or not. And wow, did it impress for the first half.This tells the tale of a family of three living in Harlem, New York: Jende Jonga, a Cameroonian immigrant, has come to the United States to provide a better life for himself, his wife, Neni, and their six-year-old son.“As often as she could, she sat in the library to do her homework, or went to office hours to hound professors for advice on what she needed to do to get better grades so she could get into a great pharmacy school. She was going to make herself proud, make Jende proud of his wife, make Liomi proud of his mother. She’d waited too long to become something, and now, at thirty-three, she finally had, or was close enough to having, everything she’s ever wanted in life.”It's really been a while since a book made me think, \"just \n  one\n more chapter.\" But Imbolo Mbue weaved together such an intricate story that I was left feeling truly attached to this family.I was rooting for Nini whenever we got to read snippets of her studying. I felt truly inspired to start studying myself after finishing the book. And I just have so much admiration for her determination... I think I highlighted one too many parts of this book because of it. (And - fun fact - we both hate the smell of coffee!!)It also discussed the topic of immigration in a really eye-opening way:“Listen to me,” Bubakar said, somewhat impatiently. “As far as Immigration is concerned, there are many things that are illegal and many that are gray, and by ‘gray’ I mean the things that are illegal but which the government doesn’t want to spend time worrying about. You understand me, abi? My advice to someone like you is to always stay close to the gray area and keep yourself and your family safe. Stay away from any place where you run into police—that’s the advice I give to you and to all the young black men in this country. The police is for the protection of white people, my brother. Maybe black women and black children sometimes, but not black men. Never black men. Black men and police are palm oil and water.”And not only immigration, but a lot of topics were handled so well—I felt like the author took everything I didn't know how to articulate and put it on paper. And those types of books - the kind that open up your heart and educate you - will stay with me for a long time.But circling back to the plot of this story, Jende can hardly believe his luck when he lands a job as a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a senior executive at Lehman Brothers.Everything is seemingly going okay for the Jongas— Jende's immigration court date seems to be years from now, Neni is acing her precalculus finals thanks to the help of her instructor, and Liomi is doing well in his classes.But then the financial world is rocked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. And Jende and Neni have to stay strong in order to keep their family together.“Please let’s not think like that,” Neni said. “You have a job for now, eh? As long as we have Mr. Edwards, we have a job. Are we not better off today than all those people walking out of Lehman? Look at them. I just feel so sorry for them. But then, we don’t know what’s on the road coming for us, too. We just don’t know. So let’s only be happy that today we were spared.”They continuously encourage each other to be hopeful, to believe that they would one day realize the dream of becoming Americans. But everything was about to change, one way or another, for everyone in this country.So, as great as those 100-200 first pages were, the ending really, really bothered me. I hated how horrendous Jende’s actions were and was even more appalled when he acted as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. Just...his sudden change of character towards the end didn’t sit well with me.And Neni’s hate towards other girls threw me out of the story as well.“Cindy’s things she planned to reserve for special occasions. She would wear them to weddings and anniversaries to show those girls that even though she had returned home and was living among them, she was not one of them—she was now a woman of class, with real designer items, and none of them could compete with her.”Overall, a great introduction to a compelling family, but with a number of problematic behaviours and flaws while unraveling their story.ARC kindly provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.3.5 stars*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

One of our presidential candidates is foaming at the mouth about “extreme vetting” for immigrants. But then along comes “Behold the Dreamers,” a debut novel by a young woman from Cameroon that illuminates the immigrant experience in America with the tenderhearted wisdom so lacking in our political discourse. While another author might have played that imperative title sarcastically, for Imbolo Mbue, “Behold the Dreamers” is a kind of angelic annunciation of hope, which ultimately makes her story even more poignant.After a childhood of extreme poverty, Mbue came to this country in 1998 — recent enough to retain the optimism of an immigrant but long enough to understand our national schizophrenia about foreigners. Her novel is about a family from Cameroon living in Harlem on the eve of striking disruption. The United States is about to elect its first black president and descend into the Great Recession. But Jende Jonga, the hero of this tale, has his mind set on only one thing: becoming a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a hotshot Lehman Brothers executive. Jende and his wife, Neni, have been preparing for the interview for days. They’ve spent hours googling “the one question they ask at every job interview.” With the help of a volunteer at the library, they’ve written up a résumé that describes Jende as “a man of grand accomplishments”: farmer, street cleaner. . . .To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/entert...To watch my interview with Imbolo Mbue at The Washington Post, click here:https://www.facebook.com/poststyle/vi..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.836491"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.836491"]]

Not for one day…”I received an advance-read copy of this book from the publisher, Random House, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\\tImbolo Mbue’s Behold the Dreamers had its highs and lows. I’d like to first say that I love that Mbue is a native of Limbe, Cameroon. Rather than telling a story from hearsay and secondhand experiences, she was able to paint a realistic portrait of a modern-day Cameroonian family. The inflection in their tone and dialogue, their traditions, they all came through brilliantly here. Yet this, unfortunately, wasn’t enough for me to give this one high praise.Behold the Dreamers was a wonderful title for a work that told a story of exactly that: a family with dreams in their eyes and a determination to fight for a good life in America the Great. The writing was simple; particularly for the first large chunk, 40% or so. It was as simple as a burlap sack, and it was a bit too rudimentary to really pull me in. It definitely DID NOT strike me as literary fiction, which some have labeled it as. On the other hand, I will say that it was culturally enlightening to read about the traditions of the Cameroonians, to recognize the cadence in their voices as different from those of their American counterparts. That dialogue between the immigrants read more jauntily, more authentically, than any of the other dialogue in this novel, the only thing that seemed dazzlingly organic, and that was a let-down for me. \\tThere were assuming plot leaps that lurched the timeline forward in a way that made me feel I’d missed something, where I, as a reader, missed the growth of the characters and how their bonds with one another grew or were sullied, and that made the read less enthralling. It made me invest less in it. This wasn’t like plot twists that kept you guessing—this isn’t some mystery or thriller—but major life decisions that the reader had no warning were even possible, even a thought process in the characters’ minds, that just tumbled into the plot. That, to me, was a sure sign of the author’s inability to weave a plot with finesse. It felt like I was on a bumpy car trip, feeling every pothole and speed bump. Definitely not a luxury car ride. And then there was the fact that it took way too long for any meaningful action to transpire. This novel was set on the backdrop of the collapse of the housing bubble--the protagonist's employer worked in a high-up position and Lehman Bros--but I literally didn't even notice that this was part of the plot until after I finished reading it. It was stated, yes, but it wasn't made an integral enough part of the plot to make me feel the tension. By the time I looked at my counter to see that I was over 40% of the way through this novel, I was shocked at how little I was invested in the characters, at how much valuable space had gone to waste in telling the story thus far.  There was a high point where the action picked up and it looked like character evolution would take place—like Neni would fight the traditions of her upbringing and stand on her own, like she would go to bat and battle her hardest for her dreams, which is what she came to America to do. But then I landed with a heavy flop at that ending and literally said to myself, “Oh, I’d better not turn this page for this to be it!” (Literally, imagine me sitting at my computer, finger poised over the right arrow saying, “Oh, this had better not be it!” only to find that when I did turn the page, that was it.) (view spoiler)[Without totally spoiling the plot for anyone, I'll say that this one ended with the characters not having fully transformed. A cliche bow-tie ending it was not, but it was still a deeply unsatisfying way to go out, my goodness.

Was pretty sure I liked Jende for most of the book until he did something I abhorred. Nein too does something, out of desperation, but I did not much like her for it. The Edwards, Cindy and Clark were pretty much representative of the privileged culture, or at least how they are usually portrayed. I did eventually sympathize with them all for various reasons and in the end that didn't matter to me so much as the story. If it shows nothing else it definitely showed the disconnect between immigrants, the privileged and even those who were born here. So a worthy and timely read, especially here in the USA where one of our presidential nominees is running on a platform of fear, hatred and bigotry. This book shows how tenuous the hold on their lives are for some. Lawyer fees, trying to get papers to stay in this country, work toward a better for themselves and their families. The author set this just before the collapse of our economy in 2008 and in fact Clark Edward works for Lehman Brothers as an executive, as he loses his job, his marriage disintegrates as does the future of Jende's family. Jobs are now scarce, college educated people willing to take the jobs the immigrants once occupied. So many lost their houses and their livelihoods. I enjoyed reading about the difference in their lives between New York, living in Harlem and Cameroon, where they are from. The ending surprised me somewhat, well I didn't expect the direction it took. But, for this family it made sense. This novel is not perfect and like most probably doesn't reflect all but it does give the reader an inside view of one such immigrant family.

There were many things I liked about Behold the Dreamer, but in significant ways it ended up feeling like a missed opportunity. Imbolo Mbue tells the story of married couple Jende and Nemi, who have moved from Cameroon to New York City to pursue their dream of a better life in America. The story is told from their alternating points of view. Jende works as a chauffeur for a high finance guy who works on Wall Street in 2008 at the time of the financial collapse, and Nemi works odd jobs and goes to college hoping ultimately to become a pharmacist. The set up is really good, and Jende and Nemi are strong multi-dimmensional characters. Mbue conveys a strong sense of the Cameroon they left, what led them to leave their home, their continuous financial struggle to live in New York and the precariousness of their attempt to gain legal status in the US. But there were many ways in which the story lacks the depth its set up promised. Most notably, much of the story is taken up with the relationship Jende and Nemi develop with Jende's employer and his family, and that aspect of the story felt overly dramatic, cartoonish and ultimately a bit too sentimental. While Jende and Nemi are rich characters when they deal with each other and other members of the Cameroon community in New York, they seemed to lose dimension when dealing with this wealthy Manhattan family and the family itself felt like it was composed of types rather than real people. I felt that Mbue could have done so much more with the dynamics in the relationships between these characters. Having said that, the strengths of Mbue's first novel are sufficient to make me want to read her next novel.

You’re kidding! Cameroon, where some families are so poor, we’re told, they give their children away. It’s supposedly a win-win. The kids have a better life with a wealthier family, and the poor family has one less mouth to feed. Sound appealing? No? I didn’t think so, and neither did Jende Jonga.To escape poverty, Jende went to America as a visitor, overstayed his visa, brought his wife and young son over, and now keeps trying to get ‘papers’ so he won’t be deported. They live in a tiny, unpleasant fifth-floor walk-up in Harlem, and they all sleep in one bed. But – they are in America and their son is going to an American school! “‘Columbus Circle is the center of Manhattan. Manhattan is the center of New York. New York is the center of America, and America is the center of the world. So we are sitting in the center of the world, right?’”Cameroon isn’t a war zone, so their dream is pretty simple – good jobs, good schools, nice home. Neni is studying chemistry at a community college, dreaming of being a pharmacist. They have many Cameroonian friends, some on the other side of the country, and a few are influential. One gives Jende a reference to wealthy Clark Edwards, a Wall Street man looking for a chauffeur. Long story short, (not a spoiler), Jende works for Clark, Neni gets work with his wife, Cindy, and they become friendly, one-on-one, somewhat at arm’s length like family servants. Clark is always working, so Cindy busies herself with social functions and their two boys. But then the oldest boy announces he’s going to search for fulfilment in India and skip college.Neni finds Cindy in a bad way one day, and Cindy suddenly confides in her.“‘I came from a poor family. A very, very poor family.’ ‘Me, too, madam—’ Cindy shook her head. ‘No, you don’t understand,’ she said. ‘Being poor for you in Africa is fine. Most of you are poor over there. The shame of it, it’s not as bad for you.’”Neni has enough sense to stay quiet, [while I, smugly feeling more culturally aware than Cindy, was annoyed with Cindy]. As it turns out, however, Cindy’s family and youth actually WERE more horrifying than Neni’s. And there is, of course, some truth to accepting as the norm whatever you and your friends have. [I feel suitably humbled.]Neni sympathises, realising she had, and still has, a warm, loving family. So she keeps Cindy’s secrets to herself, just as she keeps her own legal situation secret. Cindy’s dream is a happy home. Or as Jende hopes“ . . . some marriages did not need to be happy. They needed only to be sufficiently comfortable, and he hoped the Edwardses would at least find that.”As Jende struggles with their legal troubles, Clark’s company, Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy, plunging the world economy into the Global Financial Crisis. Jende has overheard many conversations but has been very discreet, keeping Clark’s secrets to himself.Eventually, Jende and Neni realise their jobs are in jeopardy and the way they each choose to deal with the secrets they’re keeping drives a wedge between them. Not only will you see the fallout from the GFC from a different angle, you may appreciate being exposed to another culture, a lot older than most.This seems very real and plausible to me, sad, true and one of those I-don’t-know-what-the-answer-is situations. There is a fair bit of teaching and preaching, but that’s understandable. Something I did notice (again, in a book by an African-born author living and writing in America) was this, from Neni.“Nothing shamed her more than black people embarrassing themselves in front of white people by behaving the way white people expect them to behave. That was the one reason why she had such a hard time understanding African-Americans—they embarrassed themselves in front of white people left and right and didn’t seem to care.”The English of the Cameroonians fluctuates between relatively proper English, and then a kind of loose English with some Cameroonian words and phrases thrown in, and finally there’s the excited language they use with each other in America. It’s a loud, colourful, mish-mash of English, French, Cameroonian and could be the language used in Cameroon now, Cameroonian Pidgin English. I loved this particular passage, where Neni’s and her friend are having coffee with Neni’s handsome young instructor, who shocks them when he mentions his boyfriend.“The instructor laughed. ‘I take it you ladies don’t know many men with boyfriends?’Fatou shook her head. Neni’s mouth remained ajar. ‘I don’t know no gay man from my country,’ Fatou said. ‘But my village we used to got one man who walk lika woman. He hang his hand for air and shake his derrière very nice when he dance.’ ‘That’s funny.’‘Everybody say he musto be woman inside, but nobody call him gay because he got a wife and childrens. And we no got no word for gay. So, I am happy to meet you!’There is a lot of Cameroonian food and hospitality. Neni misses bargaining for food and reminisces about how mothers stretch meals in Cameroon, cooking so children take leftovers to school for lunch. [Handy tip follows!]“If the woman was smart she would make the food extra-spicy, so the children would have a sip of water with every bite, get full faster, and the food would last longer.”For Fatou, the friend shocked by the gay instructor, she finds there’s a price to pay for bringing her kids to America. They tell people they are American.“Only when prodded did they reluctantly admit that well, actually, our parents are Africans. But we’re Americans, they always added. Which hurt Fatou and made her wonder, was it possible her children thought they were better than her because they were Americans and she was African?”And for Neni, if her children were to miss out on growing up in America:“They would lose the opportunity to grow up in a magnificent land of uninhibited dreamers.”Thanks to NetGalley and HarperCollins UK for the preview copy from which I've taken the liberty of quoting."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.862802"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.862802"]]

Undoubtedly, there can be truth to that, but what happens to that dream when it seems elusive, out of reach or comes undone?I was hooked right from the start by the story of Jende Jongo, formerly of Limbe, Cameroon, finding a dream job as a chauffeur for an executive at Lehman Brothers, in the year 2007. He’s been driving a cab in NYC, but better pay and a better car to drive are not the only thing that makes this job such a break, by driving a Lehman Brothers executive Jende feels he has achieved a point of pride in his work. There’s humor in Mbue’s writing about the everyday life in America, the thought process of the shopping experience in America, coming from an environment where negotiating prices is the norm. There are also the astonishments of the new immigrants experience with the availability of so much in one place, and the availability of the “finer” places to shop for clothing. There’s also a heavy dose of the reality how many difficulties may be encountered by those who come looking for a better life in America. As Dorothy comes to realize, “there’s no place like home” when she’s in Oz, but then back at Auntie Em’s she dreams of life in Oz … A heart divided. Jende’ heart is at odds between the things he has come to love about this new life, the things he misses about life in Limbe, his family there. Neni can’t bear to think of leaving everything they’ve worked for. Charming, truly compelling story, “Behold the Dreamers” is a wonderful debut novel about where we sometimes choose to call home.

Jende and Neni Jonga, along with their young son, come to New York in 2007 in search of the American Dream. She enrolls in college, with the expectation that she can eventually become a pharmacist; he secures a job as the chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a senior executive at Lehman Brothers. This position gives him a unique view of the Edwards family, themselves a very fractured take on the American Dream. Lehman brothers is teetering on the brink, and the stress is weighing heavily not just on Clark but also on his wife Cindy and their two sons: would-be hippie twentysomething Vince and wide-eyed nine-year-old Mighty. Jende is privy to much of that stress and he has to try to keep it from reaching into his own family, whose status in this country is far from certain.Imbolo Mbue tells her story from the perspectives of both Jende and Neni, though it’s not a strictly “alternating POV” kind of book. Mbue captures these two voices brilliantly, illustrating the hope and the fear, the idealism and the naiveté that comes with being an immigrant in America at the outset of the Great Recession. I was so completely invested in these two that my heart was in my throat for much of the book. The Edwards family sometimes feel like a bit of a clichéd portrayal of upper class white privilege, but it still seems clear that Mbue holds a lot of empathy for themThough it’s set in the last decade, this book holds quite a bit of pertinence in 2016. Immigration remains a huge topic in the US right now, and there’s huge swathes of xenophobia all over our country. Knowing how hard it is to start a new life in America, it’s sometimes hard for me to imagine why someone might want to—especially people of color. Mbue offers a reminder that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, highlighting the sacrifices and the impossible, often desperate, decisions that immigrants are faced with. Mbue really forced me to walk around in the shoes of her characters and think about what it must be like to be in their position. It was a really intense experience for me; I got to the last fifty pages and I couldn’t stop sobbing. So maybe I’m alone here, but I absolutely adored this book.

Jende and Neni, from Cameroon, are striving to achieve the American Dream…apartment in NYC, working hard and studying long, struggling to raise a family in the United States. They have high hopes and aspirations, and with a positive outlook, they aim to achieve their goals. Clark and Cindy are American, rich and live a lavish lifestyle. Their lives are filled with pain and despair, as they desperately try to maintain their wealth and prosperity during the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a financially devastating crisis in 2008. The two couples organically provide each other with help and support as they are faced with challenges in their personal journeys.Mbue provides valuable insight into the immigrant struggle, the perseverance and strength it takes to settle in another country, and the breaking point when home may be calling, wherever the may be. I loved the characters, their depth and their relationships with each other. A thoughtful, timely, and fast paced read.

A Cameroonian immigrant, he came to the U.S. to make a better life for himself, and he dreamed of providing opportunity for his wife, Neni, and their young son, Liomi, who eventually are able to join him in an apartment in Harlem. Neni pursues education to become a pharmacist, while Jende drives a cab and hopes for a better opportunity.Good fortune presents itself in the fall of 2007, when Jende lands a job as the chauffeur of a senior executive with Lehman Brothers, Clark Edwards. Clark and Jende build a solid relationship based on mutual respect and trust, as Jende assures Clark he will turn a blind eye (and ear) to the conversations Clark has while in the car, the people with whom Clark meets, and the places Jende takes him. Over time, Clark becomes a fixture in the Edwards family, driving Clark's mercurial wife, Cindy, as well as the couple's two sons, hippie idealist Vince, who wants to denounce all his father has worked for, and young Mighty, who is fascinated by Jende and Neni's culture. Cindy even offers Neni a temporary job as a housekeeper at the Edwards' house in the Hamptons.But as the financial crisis looms, and the pressures of working for Lehman Brothers begin taking their toll on Clark, the Edwards' marriage begins to crack under the stress, placing Neni and Jende squarely in the middle, testing both of their loyalties. Meanwhile, problems with Jende's immigration status cause more problems for the couple, straining their own marriage, as each tries to pursue their own solutions. When the Great Recession hits, it does more than cause the downfall of Lehman Brothers and a nationwide economic collapse: it throws the very idea of the American Dream into jeopardy for Jende and Neni.Imbolo Mbue's \n  Behold the Dreamers\n is a look at the immigrant experience through the eyes of a married couple, who have similar and different desires, and different solutions to their problems. This is a book about whether to fight for what you want and believe, or whether it is wiser to capitulate to forces larger and stronger than you, and how to overcome your problems. It's also the story of how people who have always seemed different suddenly find themselves falling into traditional (and not always welcomed) roles expected from their culture.I thought this was an interesting book, as it helped you understand why so many people want to leave their countries and come to America. It's both the myth of a world of opportunity, as well as the chance to prove your worth to those in your country, that beckons many to the U.S., but it is far from the perfect world so many immigrants envision. And it is a look through immigrants' eyes at the lives of those they think have everything, and notice that their problems are eerily similar in many ways. Mbue did a great job capturing the voice of Jende and Neni, and portraying their experiences and challenges. I felt as if that could be the entire story, without the drama surrounding the Edwards family, which seemed much more routine and stereotypical. And while I know what significant financial and emotional stress can do to a marriage, I really didn't like the way that Neni and Jende's characters transformed as things started going downhill for them.This is definitely a heartfelt book, about the need to feel that you're providing for your family, and the need to feel stable, and feel loved and appreciated. I felt it dragged a little at times, but Mbue is a talented writer with an ear for dialogue, and a promising future ahead of her.NetGalley and Random House provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

This is one of those books that created a fair amount of buzz during 2016. For me, it’s one of those books I wouldn’t ordinarily pick out, but I was curious to know why the book was nominated for so many awards. I enjoyed the book, initially, and found myself feeling sympathetic towards Jende and his fierce determination to stay in America and create a better life for his family. I watched with dread as he got sucked into the family drama of his employer and as cracks begin to appear in his marriage. But, as well drawn as the characters were, the last quarter of the book was just horrendous. The conclusion was certainly not what I was expecting it to be and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I think the novel points to the unrealistic expectations many immigrants have of the ‘American Dream’, and how difficult it is for anyone to achieve it, even more so during an economic crisis.  The experiences of this family are certainly realistic, which is probably a good thing, since it gives the reader a great deal of insight into the struggles of immigrant families attempting to make a life for themselves in America and the serious challenges they face. But, perhaps in the mood I’m in currently, I just didn’t want quite that much reality. The change in the character’s personalities, the deflation of ambition, the fighting spirit extinguished, coupled with the attitudes toward women, were very disturbing to me and I was left wondering just exactly what it was about this book that resonated with the critics. So, I’m kind of scratching my head here, wondering if I’m missing some major point everyone else picked up on. That’s entirely possible, but even so, I still don’t know if there are any missed nuances that could change my mind about how things turned out in the end. So, overall, this book is well written and realistic, with incredible characterizations, but ultimately, it was not really my kind of book. So here again, I’m stuck with how to rate this one and so I’ll give it the fairest rating I can which is- 3 stars"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.886866"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.886866"]]

The great thing in American is it doesn't matter what your last name is, doesn't matter if you're wealthy.\" ----Bobby JindalImbolo Mbue, a Cameroonian author, pens an incredibly inspiring debut novel, Behold the Dreamers that unfolds the stories of two families set against the backdrop of the Big Apple, one is a very poor yet hardworking immigrant family from a very small town in Africa and another is an American family who are filthy rich, as the two families come together with their growing fondness for one another, and so the inevitable curse of the Great Recession that tears each and every one from both the families apart.Synopsis:  A compulsively readable debut novel about marriage, immigration, class, race, and the trapdoors in the American Dream—the unforgettable story of a young Cameroonian couple making a new life in New York just as the Great Recession upends the economyNamed one of BuzzFeed’s “Incredible New Books You Need to Read This Summer”Jende Jonga, a Cameroonian immigrant living in Harlem, has come to the United States to provide a better life for himself, his wife, Neni, and their six-year-old son. In the fall of 2007, Jende can hardly believe his luck when he lands a job as a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a senior executive at Lehman Brothers. Clark demands punctuality, discretion, and loyalty—and Jende is eager to please. Clark’s wife, Cindy, even offers Neni temporary work at the Edwardses’ summer home in the Hamptons. With these opportunities, Jende and Neni can at last gain a foothold in America and imagine a brighter future.However, the world of great power and privilege conceals troubling secrets, and soon Jende and Neni notice cracks in their employers’ facades.When the financial world is rocked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Jongas are desperate to keep Jende’s job—even as their marriage threatens to fall apart. As all four lives are dramatically upended, Jende and Neni are forced to make an impossible choice. Jende and Neni, the young immigrant couple from Cameroon with a child, have finally managed to make a decent life in America, as Neni attends the graduate school to be eligible for a scholarship that will earn her a spot in some college to achieve her dream of becoming a pharmacist whereas Jende has bagged a decent paying as well as respectable job of a chauffeur for a filthy rich and wall street company's boss, Edward. Edward and Cindy, the middle aged American couple with two sons, have a posh lifestyle and a respectable reputation in the society, as Edward is the boss of Lehman Brothers, a Wall Street company whereas Cindy is the model American housewife with social parties and holidays in Hamptons keep her busy.But what happens to these families when the Great Recession strikes the doors of each and every Wall Street companies including Lehman Brothers and wipes off the rise of the American economy like a clean slate?While reading this book, every now and while, I had to stop myself and was forced to ponder when whether I'm reading a debut author's work, as it turned out to be miraculous and something magical, within an instant, I got a new perspective into the universe that the author has diligently created with the help of her story. Even though this is a work of fiction, I had a hard time in believing that this story ain't real. So kudos to the author for her spirit to write such a heart-touching and realistic novel that will inspire those who dream the Great American Dream to make it big in America. And here is the author who has captured the soul of a hard working man who wants to earn a green card with dignity and respect, and not illegally or in any shortcut method.The author's writing style is excellent and eloquent, laced properly with emotions that will make the readers feel deeply. The plot is so addictive that it will instantly suck in the readers right from its very start and will hold their attention till the very last page. The narrative is sensitive, emphatic and often inspired from the local Cameroonian dialect with its proper translation into English, hence the readers are in for a treat as they would get to know a lesser known language and would also be able to comprehend with the honest and real dialogues. The pacing of the book is smooth like a calm river as the author unravels the story gradually through challenges and twists.The characters from the book are extremely well developed and are developed out of realism that will help the readers feel connected to the characters. The main character, Jende, is amazing, motivating, dedicated and extremely caring family man, who thinks about his family before anything and everything else. Neni is the woman who is so much deluded by achieving a decent and glamorous American life style and she gets so much wrapped up in this great dream, that she forgets about her family and her birthplace often. Edward is the gentleman and a typical American who lives the luxurious lifestyle even if he sometimes has to excuse himself in the indecent frivolities of life. Cindy maybe a beautiful American housewife, but she is a sad and broken woman from the inside as she indulges herself into the ugly shortcuts of life. The author flawless evolves each and every characters through the inevitable challenge of the Great Recession as she throws them into the mouth of a dark age with no jobs and falling economy and overextended visa situations. The characters are, in short, quite memorable as well as enlightening to send the readers a strong message of the importance of homeland and earning respect through clean ways.In a nutshell, this is a motivating and extremely gripping story that won't let the readers to look away from the book even for once, and would help them realize the beauty, importance and meaning of earning respect in one's own society or country.Verdict:  One of the best books that I read this year!

Jende finds work as a chauffeur for a Lehman Brothers executive. The contrast between their two lives is surreal. You feel so sorry for Jende and Neni. They are such sweet people, trying so hard. And it's not that their employers are evil. The Edwards seem caring; Mrs. Edwards strokes a check for $500 so that Jende’s nephews can remain in school. The most interesting person in the class contrast is Vince. A rich man’s son who takes his father’s wealth and what it provides for granted and thinks he's a Buddhist. Maybe the one thing that is the same across race and class is parenthood. As Vince says “It amazes me, you're so different and yet you're so like my parents in so many ways”. I was fascinated by the Cameroon couple’s take on the race relations. Neni is amazed that Winston has so many white friends. She can't imagine herself being able to be herself among whites. The Edwards are definitely “the other” but yet there are strong bonds between the two couples. In fact, at times, the understanding between the women and men are stronger than between the spouses. Mbue takes her time getting to the collapse of Lehman. Her writing style is precise, not overly flowery. Things move at a good clip. She does a great job describing all the meltdowns - of job, economy, marriages, families. There is so much meat to this book. What constitutes good and evil? Right and wrong? As Natasha quotes Rumi “out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there”. It definitely makes you think about the status of illegal immigrants and the steps they take to stay in this country. It would make an excellent book club selection.

Clark Edwards, a driven wealthy senior executive at Lehman Brothers is a sympathetic character. Yes, he can be cold-hearted and demanding of his staff and family, but deep down I believe he wants to do what’s right. He sees the handwriting on the wall of the financial collapse but is ignored by superiors who shrug it aside. Meanwhile his privileged wife whose self esteem seems to depend on how many galas she is invited to, begins to self destruct as her marriage begins to fall apart and secrets she has kept for many years take their toll on her psyche.Jende and Neni Jonga are hardworking Cameroonian immigrants who come to America, the land of opportunity and struggle to make ends meet. They both end up working for the Edwards family, privy to family secrets and witness to the widening cracks in the Edwards’ seemingly perfect lives. Both families suffer the effects of this economic downfall of 2008 but I especially appreciated the immigrants’ view.This was an interesting read with important themes and compelling interrelationships.

Especially given where we are in our country at the moment with a presidential candidate who says such horrible things about immigrants. Given that we're a nation created by immigrants, I think this book is key to better understanding this key demographic. This book gives life to the immigrant experience in an incredible way. It gave life to the very topic that I've been seeing on the news for months. Between the novels exploration of the immigrant experience and it's exploration of the fall of Lehman Brothers, it's a strong novel that also makes you think so much about poverty and wealth, family, how we treat other people and what we might do to find a better life for ourselves and our families. I think this is a book that can really allow people to better understand what it's like to leave your country and seek a life in America. It's certainly not for the faint of heart. And putting the life of wealth beside the life of an average immigrant, really makes those culture differences all the more stark.The thing that I most appreciated about this book was how it focuses on the small details of life and how they come together in the lives of people. It really gave a great deal of texture to the story. As I mentioned before, I highly recommend this novel. It's such a timely, charming and important novel!

And in this case, the striving towards the elusive American Dream. The book looks at two different angles of the American Dream story in the late 2000s. It primarily focuses on a Cameroonian couple, Jende and Neni, and how they try to make a life for themselves and their son in New York City. The book shows their struggles with searching for employment, immigration rights and how the constant threat of deportation is always looming large over their heads. The fear and anxiety caused by this constant need to look over one's shoulder and to never feel settled or secure plays almost like a main character in the story. It provides the background to every conversation and decision made, in particular by Jende, and provides a very tense atmosphere throughout the book. Neither Jende or Neni are perfect characters. They are very richly written and feel quite authentic as the two characters have traits that are both admirable and ones that are less so. At times I absolutely hated Jende for his ideas about what is a husband's role and what is a wife's. He is a character that will test you because there are occasions when you will feel so much goodwill towards him, and at other times he will crush you with his seeming coldness or blinkered narrow mindedness. Neni was wonderfully complex too. I loved her almost blinding desire for everything American and how it made her do things that you could have thought were out of her character. America both tested and changed her. The book had a lot to say on the marriage between these two and how this striving for some intangible American Dream slowly twisted them further apart and tested the elasticity of their relationship. The story also looks at the flip side of America. It looks at wealth and materialism through the eyes of a New York couple who become linked with Jende and Neni. This couple, the Edwards, felt a little less authentic to me. Although they were written well and I enjoyed their storylines, I felt the plots involving them were a little more clichéd and perhaps just lacking a maturity of writing. However, this is a debut novel so I am more than willing to forgive a few flaws because this whole book showed wonderful promise for the future of this writer. I was thoroughly gripped by the story of Jende and Neni. This was very much a character driven novel and those are always my favourites. It was a very quiet, subtle read and ultimately, I found the book to be a wholly moving reading experience.

The Jonga's from Cameroon have been in New York for a short time and are eking out an existence in the new country in which they've dreamed for years of making a better life for themselves and their children. The Clarks are a moneyed family, the husband an investment banker with Lehman Brothers, the wife a pampered socialite who summers at her second home in the Hamptons. The fates of these two families intertwine when Mr. Clark hires Mr. Jonga as his driver.Because it is set in such perilous times, the novel provides a fertile setting for pondering on the \"American Dream.\" The Jonga's hope to find what they've seen on t.v. in Cameroon, people who look like them who are succeeding. Mrs. Jonga even cites The Cosby Show and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air as inspirations for what people of color might accomplish in the U.S.. And things seem to be right on track when the Jonga's land that chauffeuring job as he is well paid and they are able to make their rent and to set some money aside in savings each month. But of course, the Jonga's journey toward their dream is ill timed, and Mr. Jonga finds his employer is right at the epicenter of the economy's collapse, his fate tied so closely to that of a Wall Street titan.The Clarks would seem to have it all. Everything the Jonga's are seeking. Yet, they don't appear to be a particularly happy family, and as the Jonga's have more opportunities to spend time with the family (always in service roles) they increasingly sense that perhaps the American Dream isn't all it's made out to be. When the economy reveals the great hidden flaws that will doom Lehman Brothers, both families feel its effects with different but painful results.Mbue has crafted both an interesting and timely debut novel here. She does not employ much subtlety and at times the seeming simplicity with which she approaches the novel's most complex issues is startling, but overall I liked that technique. Seeing and feeling the various dilemmas from the perspective of people fresh faced and hopeful versus those cynical and defeated made for a more productive study of the issues and led me to better understand the complex emotions being communicated. With the focus on immigrants in our current political climate, the novel provides the reader an opportunity for the development of empathy and perhaps to take a more honest look at the things we most earnestly pursue.

(First appeared at http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.co...)There's been no shortage of controversial, combative rhetoric about immigration in this election cycle, so much so that it's hard to separate the Internet meme from the facts. But if you want to find out just how badly our stupid immigration system is broken, check out Imbolo Mbue's terrific, morally complex, heartbreaking debut novel, Behold The Dreamers.But this novel isn't just about how difficult it is for those who come to this country seeking opportunity, it's about how the American system as a whole has been rigged such that in many cases many people never really have a chance at all. Maybe it's a pessimistic view of the American dream, but imagine yourself in New York City in 2009, at the height of the financial meltdown, and it's not hard to see how pessimism could be pervasive.The story is about a Cameroonian immigrant named Jende who comes to the U.S., drives a taxi, saves fiercely, and finally is able to bring his wife Neni and six-year-old son over to the U.S. For a minute, all is well — Jende gets a \"high-paying\" job as a chauffeur for a Lehman Brothers executive named Clark, Neni begins taking classes to become a pharmacist, and they're generally enamored of the Big City and the opportunities it affords.But then it all goes wrong. For everyone. But what's fascinating about this novel is how Mbue turns expectation on its head. She shows us how crisis and pressure expose and exacerbate the flaws in even the best people...and even more so in the worst. You'd expect that you're rooting against the rich banker Clark and rooting for the hardworking immigrant Jende. But it's certainly not that simple.Along with dysfunctional family stories, immigrant stories are one of my favorite subgenres of fiction — Americanah (one of my favorite books ever) to all of Jhumpa Lahiri's stories to The Newlyweds, The Sleepwalker's Guide To Dancing, and The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, among many others. And this novel takes its place firmly in that pantheon. It's such an assured, well-written debut — as smooth and readable as any veteran writer could produce. Highly recommended!

I like finding new talented unique authors. And authentic African authors are delivering (I loved The Fishermen by Chigozie Obioma and there is just no comparison to my top favorite Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie). Behold the Dreamers had some highs and some lows. In some of the good parts it had some shadow of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (which is a huge compliment), in the low parts it was a soap opera (which is a real non-compliment). I am willing to see the lows as an immature choices, birth pains of a debut novel. I really struggled between 3 and 4 stars. And I am looking forward to see the next book by the author.Imbolo Mbue is a native Cameroonian, from Limbe. Her characters Jende and his wife Neni are also from Limbe, and they are so authentic, that it is joy for the eyes and the heart. Cindy and Clark Edwards are portrayed a bit more like how you imagine super rich disconnected privileged people. With drivers and cooks, and no worries about money, but other problems that make them not like their life too much. They have everything, but not enough.I loved some of the conversations between Clark and Jende (which made me like Jende). I did not like Jende's attitude towards his wife (which made me not like Jende). Overall, the characters were flawed in the right amount to be both likable and not far from perfect. Jende is under the threat of being deported (right after reading The Sun Is Also a Star with the same main theme was really strange coincidence). Being an immigrant in America is hard, being black immigrant even harder. The writing was good, and the culture was interesting. I did have a problem with some of the plot, and the \"soap opera\" choices towards the end. That's actually the main thing that convinced me to go with a 3 star score (representing almost 3.5 stars), still with a close call could go a notch higher."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.978799"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.978799"]]

My opinions are my own.I've read a lot of immigration stories the past few years, but this one stands out for its unique context. Not only did I become interested in Jende and Neni Jonga's struggle to acquire the necessary papers to stay in New York, I also appreciated the parallel story of Clark and Cindy Edwards and the collapse of Lehman Brothers.On the surface you wouldn't think these two families would have much in common, the poor immigrants struggling for their dream versus the wealthy socialites living the American dream, but Mbue does an excellent job drawing parallels and pulling apart everyone's expectations. Each person in this novel touched my heart in unique ways, drawing me in to their complex characters.The American dream, especially in the face of immigration and the collapse of Wall Street, is ambiguous and ever-shifting in this novel, which I really appreciate. There are no easy answers or simple solutions for these dream-seekers.\"No, but it's our government and it's our country. We love it, we hate it, it's still our country. How man go do?\" These words, spoken at the end of the novel, could be said about the United States or about Cameroon. That's a tricky and pretty brilliant piece of writing for a debut novelist.Embedded within those huge themes are also stories of marriage, independence and personal pride. Again, Mbue does not provide easy answers or predictable responses. She allows her characters to fight through complex emotions and reactions. In doing so, Mbue puts a good deal of faith in her readers to appreciate the truth of what she's writing and who these people are. In the end, even when I don't agree with everyone's actions, I respect them. For me, that's a reading win.I look forward to discovering what this author comes up with next."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.989011"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:20.989011"]]

[["isbn", "35259724"], ["title", "Behold the Dreamers"], ["author", "Imbolo Mbue"], ["date", "Nov 10, 2016"], ["review_text", "Really a 3.5 star review, I rounded this review up as it’s an important subject matter at the moment, particularly to Americans (after their choice for President) but also in Ireland and Europe. To begin with, I must explain that I am a child of legal immigrants in Australia, who ultimately decided that the lifestyle in their homeland Ireland was better than the Australian lifestyle on offer and so sold up and returned after 8 years. So I grew up with the ongoing debate of which is better money and large houses or family and education (the free education system was better then in Ireland than in Oz). So I understood that in Behold the Dreamers, no matter what their initial excitement at being in the US, one or other of the characters were always going to question which is best, the American dream of the pursuit of money, status and the big houses or home, family and culture. Every immigrant asks these questions on a regular basis for the rest of their lives no matter what their decisions are on the way. So this question must always be central to any story on immigration, which it is in this book.I also know an Irish woman who married an illegal Nigerian immigrant to Ireland. So I am aware of the fear they lived with not knowing until last minute that he would be allowed to stay in Ireland or deported. He eventually not only got his working permit and right of residency but eventually got Irish citizenship, in this true story. I will not spoil what happened in Behold the Dreamers but I think it’s really an important subject matter particularly for those in the USA at the moment. This is where the power of stories is important as for those unfamiliar with what it is like to live with uncertain immigration statuses can get a glimpse into that world. People in the US should really take this into account in the near future. So leaving the theme of immigration aside what is enjoyable in the book. The story is set during the Economic Crisis of 2007/8 and I read for the first time the effects it has not just on the wealthy bankers (the Edwards family) but on all those that depend on them Jende Jonga and his family, Cameroonian immigrants who work for the Edwards. The Economic Crisis blows a crack in the American Dream and its impact on the legal and not quite legal immigrants is well drawn. We also see the pressures on the married life of the wealthier Edwards. The disillusionment with the pursuit of money for its own sake and the importance of family thus become central themes in the book.Personal highlights are the descriptions of Cameroonian Food. This book made me hungry on several occasions and I absolutely must try Puff Puff for breakfast or anytime really. I liked the descriptions of Limbe and would have liked more. I loved the different descriptions of the people in the various neighbourhoods of New York, I really felt the city came to life for me in this book. The narrative is very plain and bit slow at the beginning of the story but picks up pace when the Financial collapse happens. As with many stories it's how the characters deal with a crisis that is most interesting. Neni in particular shows that she is one determined lady and will go to whatever legnths are needed to protect her family. While I liked the characters, I think I needed more in-depth characterisation to really connect to them. This is probably due to writers such as Colm Tobín, JK Rowling, Charles Dickens etc. Who make me very exacting in this area. However, overall it is an enjoyable read."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.009487"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.009487"]]

The plot was definitely interesting however limited by pacing issues. Personally, the book could have been a bit more tightly edited as it felt like it was meandering in most parts. The writing itself felt pretty bland and had no distinctive features. Maybe since this is a debut the author struggles to find her voice. While I felt that the issue of patriarchy in the Cameroonian culture was very well handled, whereas domestic abuse were glossed over not once but twice. This was indeed a wasted opportunity especially as these issues seemed to be connected. Another wasted opportunity was that of showcasing Cameroonian culture as beyond food mentions the book was completely devoid of anything distinctly Cameroonian. With regard to the characters, it felt like another episode of \"white saviours.\" The white characters were portrayed as overly sympathetic despite their flaws. Furthermore, it plays up on what seems like Uncle Tom stereotypes with Jenda and Neni falling into the traditional \"yes, sir; no sir, downplay my culture and accent\" type of mentality. This was done at the expense of the character development of the main characters and was quite possibly the biggest let down. Despite these flaws I do believe that the book adequate captures the immigrant experience during a tough time in the US. The gradual disillusionment with American lifestyle was one of the most interesting aspects of the book for me and definitely the saving grace. I would very hesitantly recommend this book but I do believe that there are aspects of it that can be adopted for a curriculum despite it failings in cultural exposition.

Neni and Jende Jonga, the Cameroonian wife and husband, are rendered with a lot of wit and warmth, the kind of people I'd like to sit down and chat with. We see the Jonga's meager economic situation in harsh contrast to that of the wealthy Wall Street family (the Edwards family) that employs them. And yet at times the Jongas seem happier than the Edwards. Eventually, relentless difficulties take their toll on both families.

As frustrating as this book was to read, Mbue does a decent job of making this book a tale about marriage, identity, social class, immigration, patriarchy, domestic violence, mental health, relationships and xenocentrism. I wanted to give this book 2 stars when I got half way through the book. BTD got super frustrating towards the middle when the storyline focused more on the Edwards family instead of Jende and Neni. I didn't care about Cindy and Clark's failing marriage and the rich people problems they endured - I HATED reading about all their stresses! It stressed ME out! If I wanted to read a book about white, rich people problems, I would pick up a book by any of these white authors - no shade. I found Mbue's writing style simple, direct, succinct. BTD was very easy to read but the plot dragged out for way too long. This book could have been a solid 150 pages, sans the drama with the Edwards family. A part of me feels like the publishers promoted this book heavily because Jende and Neni put America on a pedestal. Everything about America is good in their eyes; through their lenses, America is that great place, even as they go through deep struggles. I hated that for most of this book, Jende and Neni looked down on their country of origin/their culture and revered America so much that they didn't see how desperate they were - especially Neni! Also, Jende gave me serious 'Uncle Tom' vibes, just because of how willingly subservient he acted towards the Edwardses; but when he was home, he was so high and mighty when he dealt with his wife.I'm so glad the novel ended the way it did. Once the story shifted away from the Edwards family to Jende and Neni's family, I enjoyed this novel more - I empathized with Jende and Neni and truly understood their struggles. I kind of wish Mbue spent more time describing Jende, Neni and their son- Liomi's physical features so I could actually picture them in my mind, as she did the Edwards family. The ending was realistic to me and made me appreciate Jende's character evolution. This book is obviously fiction, but when will people realize that the 'American dream' is a myth?I could go on and on and on and on and on about my bittersweet experience with this book.

The Washington Post review by Ron Charles (which you can read on this site) was headed “the one book that Donald Trump should read.” Like the protagonists of her novel, Jende Jonga and his wife Neni, Imbolo Mbue is a native of Limbe, in Cameroon, living as an immigrant in New York City. It’s the authenticity that derives of that “knowing whereof she speaks” that is the great appeal of the novel. I liked the accounts of the labor-intensive Cameroonian feasts Neni occasionally cooks up, and the dialect you hear the odd glimpse of in the novel (“Make man no say I no be warn ei say America no easy.”) The precarious rhythms and fragile dreams of undocumented migrant life are well dramatized in the novel; and Mbue makes some telling moral points by juxtaposing the hapless deceptions Jende and his lawyer perpetrate to bolster his flimsy claim for asylum with the infinitely more damaging false practices of his employer, Wall Street banker Clark Edwards. (The novel is set before and after the 2008 crash, and Edwards is a Lehman Bros employee.)So much for the good. What I didn’t think so great was the quality of the writing, which is rarely more than serviceable. Sometimes it feels rather naïve. This may be a supersubtle literary strategy, assimilating the narrative voice to the ingenuous voices of her “dreamers.” Pending Mbue’s second novel, though, I would say she is far less evidently a literary star than Chimamanda Adichie, to whose Americanah Behold The Dreamers has been compared.

There are economic struggles and worries, anxiety leads to minor violence - once, and desperation leads to a character unexpectedly committing a crime, but the story is primarily a tame literary domestic fiction, as in a child’s version of the original very adult Grimm’s fairy tales. The book helps sensitive readers ease into learning about many of the issues of new illegal immigrants, but the volume limit is turned on for the rest of us who expect less puffy feathering and more realism. The term “illegal immigrants” pops up once, literally, in the 61st chapter only, out of the 62 chapters in the book. However, the novel is well-written and crafted.Two families share the stage: the Jonga’s and the Edwards. The husbands are in charge of both of the families. One wife works and goes to a community college until a baby comes, and then her husband forces her to stop everything except raising the baby and their son. One family is very wealthy, the other has dreams of wealth. When thirty four years old, Jende Jonga had been a poor African farmer with no hopes and no future. But he moves to Harlem in New York City on a visitor's visa in 2004 with the help of his cousin, Winston, a lawyer and a legal immigrant. Jende had first found a job as a dishwasher, and then as a cab driver. Jende had only an elementary school education, but he is a hard worker and very diligent at improving himself. He studies an English dictionary to improve his vocabulary. Getting an American driver’s license was accomplished by possessing a temporary work permit. Jende’s immigration lawyer, Bubakar, a legal immigrant, recommended applying for asylum which meant a number of benefits could be applied for, including a temporary work permit. Also, by applying for asylum, a legal process of examination of Jende’s case begins, which means it could be years before he must see a judge. Jende saved money from his jobs for two years before he was able to bring Neni to America from Limbe, Cameroon, along with his then three-year-old child Liomi, so they could marry and begin a new life with a future. It is almost four years later for Jende and almost two years since Neni arrived in Harlem.Neni is now a health care worker at a senior nursing home after almost eighteen months since moving to America. She is also a matriculated student studying chemistry at the local community college. Her goal is to become a pharmacist. She works hard at her studies and her job, while also taking care of her little boy and her husband. Even though one day she discovers she is pregnant, she does not allow it to slow her down.Finally, three years after coming to America, Jende got a wonderful job which meant a significant economic difference to his family here in Harlem and in Africa. He drives as a chauffeur for a rich financier, Clark Edwards, and his family, Cindy, Clark’s wife, and Clark’s two sons, college student Vince and the little boy Mighty. Clark works for Lehman Brothers. It is 2007. Jende’s salary is $35,000 a year! Unimaginable, but it means a step up out of poverty for Jende and his family both here and in Africa, as he sends money to his parents and relatives.The Jonga’s become sort-of friends to the Edwards as they work as driver and maid, unable to avoid learning about the difficulties the Edwards are having - Clark is always working, Cindy is lonely and drinking, Vince wants to drop out of college and move to India. However, while the Jongas feel sympathy, they are careful to never cross the invisible but powerful social line dividing servant from employer. The Edwards are enormously wealthy compared to the Jongas, with college educations and a large apartment, sophisticated technology and a busy upper-class social life. However, something is wrong at Lehmans, where Clark works. Clark is constantly on his cell phone, speaking harshly into it, discussing ‘derivatives’. The Jongas have no idea whatsoever of derivatives and Wall Street, completely unable to grasp the economic train wreck which will soon engulf them all.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehma...(Nothing is discussed in the novel about the economic crash of 2008, except for opaque and vague references to job losses.)Little Timba is born in Harlem Hospital. She is an American citizen! The Jongas do not know this. Jende receives a letter from ICE rejecting his asylum application. He has hopes appeals will delay any decision, but anxiety about their immigration status and worrying signs from the Edwards family has made him very tense. Neni's school fee is $3,000 a semester.Will things work out the way the Jongas hope?The lives of the Jongas and the Edwards mirror each other in parallel. A death of a relative occurs to the Jongas, and a death occurs to a relative of the Edwards. A party is given by the Edwards, and a party is given by the Jongas. And so on. In this manner, the author Imbolo Mbue, a genuine Cameroon citizen, compares Cameroon culture with American WASP customs. It is quite interesting. The characters are not perfect people, but family life is important to both sets of families. However, as financial troubles mount for both families, the stress begins to threaten both marriages. (view spoiler)[Each of these marriages have fault lines, but as it turns out, one marriage which relies a great deal more on traditional values results in only that one marriage surviving, despite that both wives suffer devastating losses. Neni bows to Cameroon conservative family expectations in the end, while Cindy, a more fragile personality, finds her lonely life unbearable without using drugs and alcohol.

Behold the Dreamers follows Jende Jonga and his family, immigrants from Cameroon, and their pursuit of the American Dream in New York. Jende gets a job as a chauffeur for a Lehman Brothers executive and his family (pre-Great Recession), while Jende's wife, Neni, starts college in hopes of one day becoming a pharmacist while raising their young son. The global financial crisis of 2008 gets underway, Lehman Brothers goes bankrupt and then things get interesting. Or at least, I was hoping they would.I saw this book being pitched as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah meets Jhumpa Lahiri's The Namesake which is an insult to both novels (I haven't read Lahiri but have to imagine it's good). Imbolo Mbue seeks to be the latest writer in the 'chronicler of immigrant life in America' subgenre that has become increasingly popular over the last decade. And on paper, it seems like Behold the Dreamers would join the Adichies and Lahiris of the world. What really sunk this book for me was the writing and character development. The writing is uninspiring and flat. The character development was paper thin and, without getting into spoiler territory, I found the motives and decision-making of Jende and Neni in the last third of the book preposterous and a waste of my time (especially that ending). There was so much potential to make this book stand out and have an interesting take on the immigrant experience. Instead it felt stale and oddly underdeveloped.I can champion the message of Behold the Dreamers and really loved one scene in particular involving Neni and Cindy, the wife of the Lehman Brothers executive where it felt like maybe the book was going to take off in a different direction. But it doesn't.

So, you will definitely want to keep reading. However, Behold the Dreamers is a fictionalized realistic story of defeat. It discusses how we as human beings can \"try as we might\" and \"try, try again\", but there are forces in this world that will break us down and defeat our dreams. Jende was overwhelmingly chauvinistic (sometimes very stereotypical of African men), but he was extremely determined and hardworking. Imbolo shows us that even with these positive human traits, we may still not be able to achieve our dreams. With Jende's dreams being destroyed, he also destroyed Neni's dreams of becoming a pharmacist. Jende controlled when Neni would attend the university to study and how the money in the family was saved as well as spent, despite the fact that she too contributed financially. In the book, African women are portrayed as too dependent on the African man, while the independent American women is not looked upon too favorably. Imbolo effortlessly threw in a few cheap shots at the African American community (sometimes very typical of contemporary African writers) while the Edwardes were highly praised throughout the book no matter their flaws, serious problems or actions. African authors need to be aware that African Americans are very conscious of the many problems that exist within their community. Cheap shots from people who look just like them definitely does not help, but does add fuel to the fire. The Edwardes were portrayed as superior or better people, when, in actuality, it was Jende and Neni who displayed the superior characteristics of being human. With this, what Imbolo taught me is that Africans are not intimidated by Europeans, but that their interests are tied to that of white people. We are all connected somehow. Imbolo also sheds light on the naivete of many Africans who view the United States as this paradise where life is perfect. America is a purely capitalistic society and if one does not work (and work very hard), they will not eat. Jende's situation shows us that life in America can create extreme stress and anxiety. Lastly, Imbolo reminds us of those back home or should I say those back home won't be forgotten because they called Jende and Neni constantly in need and want of remittance funds. They too believed that life in America is easy living. Overall, I enjoyed Behold the Dreamers. In 62 numbered chapters and 382 pages, Imbolo touched on a variety of issues. Although fiction, this is partially a true story. This story is the story of many foreigners who have left their homes in search of a better life somewhere else. Excerpts of this book can be utilized in the high school classroom, especially in schools with a substantial immigrant population. I have found that some of the immigrant students experience culture shock (culture clash) and struggle with their new environment. Several chapters can be used to help them address this.

Mit Unterstützung von Freunden findet er eine Stelle als Chauffeur des wohlhabenden Bankiers Clark Edwards. Jende arbeitet, wann immer jemand in der Familie gefahren werden soll, ist loyal, stets zuvorkommend und will unbedingt zeigen, dass er diesen Job verdient hat. Doch seine Arbeitserlaubnis gilt nur bis zur Entscheidung seines Asylantrags. Neni ist mit einem Studentenvisum in den USA, das sie verpflichtet nach dem Examen das Land wieder zu verlassen. Wenn so viele andere es trotz dieser Bedingung mit Tricksen und Täuschen zu einer Greencard gebracht haben, warum sollten Neni und Jende nicht einfach Glück haben? Hilfe erhoffen sie sich von dem windigen Anwalt Bubakar. Ob Bubakar vom Asylrecht etwas versteht, können beide nicht beurteilen. Da Jende bei den Edwards alle Familienmitglieder fährt, Eltern und Kinder, bleiben ihm die Konflikte der Familie nicht lange verborgen. Reichtum macht nicht glücklich, diese Botschaft war zu erwarten. Wenig überraschend zeigt sich, dass der erfolgreiche und der eingewanderte Vater beide feste Vorstellungen vom Glück ihrer Kinder haben. Clark kennt keine Kompromisse bei der Berufswahl seiner Söhne; Jendes Traum von einem besseren Leben für den kleinen Liomi heißt unbedingt ein Leben in den USA. Die Anpassung an amerikanische Verhältnisse ist nicht leicht. Neni muss schmerzhaft erfahren, dass Menschen in den USA, die sie duzen darf und die sie freundlich behandeln, nicht ihre Freunde sind und sich noch lange nicht wie Freunde verhalten. In der Realität könnten die Jongas, selbst mit unbegrenzter Aufenthaltserlaubnis, in ihrem erträumten Land nicht Fuß fassen solange Jende bei jedem Problem in seinem Heimatdorf Geld nach Kamerun überweist. Nach der Geburt eines zweiten Kindes rückt auch Nenis Modell von Schwarzarbeit als Krankenpflegerin neben ihrem Pharmazie-Studium in weite Ferne. - Mit der Pleite der Lehman Brothers fallen die Angestellten der Clarks gemeinsam mit ihrem Arbeitgeber wie die Domino-Steine. Noch sind Jende und Neni bereit, für ihren Traum vom besseren Leben alles zu tun.In einer lockeren, jugendlichen Sprache erzählt Imbolo Mbue von einem nicht mehr so jungen Paar aus Kamerun, das für seinen Traum vom Glück in den USA bereit ist hart zu arbeiten. Gespiegelt wird das Einwanderer-Schicksal in der Begegnung mit einer wohlhabenden Familie, deren Wohlstand auf brüchigem Fundament steht. Für Menschen, die arbeiten wollen und für die es – zumindest vor 2008 - Arbeit gab, habe ich natürlich ein gutes Ende erhofft. Nach einer umfangreichen und eher gemächlichen Einführung der beiden Familien geht es nach der Lehman-Pleite im Leben der Jongas und der Edwards in schnellen Schnitten Schlag auf Schlag. Die Entwicklung der Personen ist zwar im Kopf des Lesers nachvollziehbar, wenn man bereit ist, alles über Bord zu werfen, was man bisher über die Figuren dachte, jedoch weniger nachvollziehbar durch eine geschilderte Entwicklung der Figuren. Trotz dieses Ungleichgewichts zwischen den Roman-Teilen besteht die Geschichte der Jongas und der Edwards aus warmherzigen, einfühlsam beobachteten Szenen, die viel über afrikanisches und US-amerikanisches Denken vermitteln können.

All is well at the beginning of the story with some cracks beginning to form here and there within their own families. With the 2008 collapse of Wall Street a major turn of events happens affecting the Jonga + Edward's families, these families begin to crumble. Life gets intense and family members do the unimaginable to survive. This in turn affects the lives of the other family and vice versa.

Behold the Dreamers is a book you won't want to read without friends to discuss it with. Pour the wine and pop the popcorn, because you will want to pick apart every decision these characters make.Jende and his wife Neni have worked harder than most of us can imagine to emigrate from their native Cameroon and build a life in America. When Jende is hired as a chauffeur for an executive at a massive financial firm, their dreams seem to have finally found solid footing, especially when Neni is invited to work for the executive's wife on a temporary basis. However, it's impossible for Jende and Neni to work for their new employers without getting involved in their lives. They see and hear everything. They're privy to secrets both personal and professional, and despite their wealth, their employers' private lives are not always pretty. Further thickening the plot are Jende and Neni's own struggles to remain in the country legally.How far would you go to build the life you've always dreamed of? Are some bad choices excusable depending on the circumstances? I suspect there will be many differing opinions on this score, as even Jende and Neni don't always see eye to eye on it. I loved all the questions this book brought to my mind, but I have to admit, I wished for an ending with a little more impact. It's a minor quibble, though, when the surprises and twists were so effective.With regards to Random House and Goodreads for the advance copy, which I was lucky enough to win in a recent giveaway.

The characters were very well developed and definitely most of them had serious development through the story.The novel touches on sooo many themes (immigration, greed and corruption, marriage and relationships, family and cultural ties, social class, race and gender, etc). The writing was beautiful and the struggles of so many people felt so real (especially with the present day setting).My favorite characters were Mighty and Jende. And for once I didn't really hate any of the characters. Yes many people did things I disagreed with or made me mad, but this novel really shows the struggles of each person. So while I didn't agree with their actions, I didn't automatically assume that their actions made them a terrible person.

Le banquier de Manhattan, son épouse, leurs fils, Jende et Nenni tous portent ce rêve d'un meilleur pour eux ou pour leurs descendants.

They are from Cameroon, striving to make a life in America, specifically in Harlem, NYC. Ms. Mbue, herself from Cameroon, provides us with a unique and authoritative perspective of their quotidian lives, right down to the American supermarket experience. Mbue also takes us through the Labyrinth that is the US Immigration process; it is complicated, distressing, and ripe for cheating. Jende's immigration lawyer says it most succinctly: \"We all do what we gotta do to become American, abi?\" \"Behold the Dreamers\" isn't just about the Jonga family, but also the Edwards family. Clark Edwards works for Lehman Brothers, and he and his socialite wife, Cindy, and their two sons, live the privileged life of the rich and successful; the 1%.As the story begins, Jende has gotten a coveted job as a driver for Clark Edwards. The year is 2007 and so the reader knows what Jende and Clark do not; the imminent demise of Lehman and the destruction of the US economy.While driving Clark, and his family, Jende learns of the perks and privileges of the rich. ​Soon Neni is asked to help Cindy in the Hamptons over the summer and she, too, learns about the \"lifestyle\" of the rich and prosperous. ​These passages are among my favorite because they highlight the acute differences between the lives of the rich and the lives of the poor in the US. What Clark and Cindy find to be huge problems, Jende​ and Neni​ can only puzzle over. The way ordinary people perceive \"rich people's problems\" is fascinating.​ Yet, Mbue doesn't paint the Edwards family as being callous or intentionally cruel; the are portrayed as having their own demons - real to them. ​In fact, neither the Jongas not the Edwards are portrayed as saints. Mbue gives all her main characters realistic human vices and virtues.All seems well until Jende and Neni are suddenly thrust in the middle of Clark and Cindy's marriage, which has become chaotic. Each is keeping a secret from the other, and only Jende and Neni know these incendiary secrets. What should they do out of loyalty and concern? What should they do out of self-preservation? As the novel rushes to conclusion, we are left to question not merely the American verses the African condition, but our shared human condition as a whole."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.165625"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.165625"]]

While I rated both three stars, Colson Whitehead's book is on the higher end of that rating for me, and Imbolo Mbue's book is on the lower end.Maybe it's just me, because most of my GR friends and critics alike seemed to put this book on a pedestal. I just didn't click with anything about it. I didn't like any of the characters besides the children, and in fact I was annoyed by most of them, especially Neni. I didn't really care much for the plot as it was presented, which was surprising to me as immigration is such a big issue right now and I am open-minded as far as immigration as reading subject. I don't think the author went far enough to describe just what was so bad about living in Cameroon to these characters, beyond just wanting to be American. I am American and since I haven't lived anywhere else I might be underestimating the struggles of living in a place that doesn't have the freedoms that America offers, but most of what Mbue offered as far as descriptors of their past life in Cameroon sounded awesome - much better than the life they're currently living in New York. I think in my mind I attributed some of the reasons I know about for immigration from the news and current events, but it was hard to connect with my main characters without understanding their motivations. It felt like I was cutting Mbue some slack in her character development that I shouldn't have.Besides Jende working for the rich Edwards family as their driver, they really could have been cut from the story entirely as the whole Wall Street crisis aspect was so detached that it felt like a totally different book at times. I think I would have enjoyed this more had Mbue focused more on her immigrant family, and devoted the pages to making them more fleshed-out and sympathetic, rather than spending the pages on the Edwardses when it doesn't fit too well.For me personally, I would have rated this 2 stars because I didn't much like the book, except for the fact that I do like Imbolo Mbue's writing style. I think she has interesting ideas and a unique perspective; I just didn't care for this offering. I think I would take a chance on reading another book by her in future to find out for sure."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.168669"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.168669"]]

Prentice Oyemi's narration is stunning. He does such an incredible job moving between African, American, male and female characters. His performance is beautiful.I am a reader who prefers description and character development over plot. Unfortunately the writing is very flat, the story never gets going and it's message was lost in artificiality. Every time the I thought the story would pick up it fell away again. Overall I was very disappointed.Neni is the best developed of the characters and the one scene, too far toward the end of the book, where we see her passion for her education was too little too late. That was the highlight of the book for me, but it wasn't nearly enough.Jende was never developed enough, neither was his son, his employers or friends. To me it felt like Neni or Jende could have been from anywhere in the world. It was their poverty that defined them. Cameroon was mentioned frequently but it wasn't until a death in the family where we got a heartfelt description of where the family had come from. Even then, the conditions of their previous lives before moving to New York had not nearly enough attention, leaving a big hole in the history of the main characters' lives.The book has been massively overhyped with Buzzfeed calling it a must read book of the summer. There are many, much better books that have been published in 2016 (I recommend Here Comes the Sun, by Nicole Dennis-Benn) or by authors who are originally from African countries (try Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie as one of the best).For people who have been interested to read this book having seen the hype over it I would instead recommend authors such as Adichie, or to Jhumpa Lahiri, Khaled Hosseini, Zadie Smith, and to the lesser known, emerging authors such as Nicole Dennis-Benn and Chigozi Obiama. All of these authors have written better examinations of topics similar to what has been attempted here by Imbolo Mbue."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.192173"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.192173"]]

In the days before the collapse of Lehmann Brothers illegal immigrant from Cameroon - Jende Jonga gets a job as a chauffeur for a Wall Street man Clark Edwards. Jende is fighting cruel American immigration system trying to get a green card; his lawyer advised him to petition for asylum. Jende believes that America is the place for him to become somebody and for his family to have a good life, surely better than the one they could have in Africa. His wife Neni believes in America even more. Jende after working hard in NYC saved enough money to bring his wife and his child to the States. Now they live in Harlem. She is studying hoping to become a pharmacist; their kid is in the Sates on his way to becoming a respectable American man and Jeden just got a well-paid job as a private driver. Their life seems to be going in a good and stable direction. But it is 2008 and as we know, in that year a great economic crisis destroyed lives of many honest and hardworking people. And it is harder for the Jongas when they don't have papers to stay and work in America legally. Because of Jende work as a driver and Neni summer job for Mrs. Edwards they learn their secrets that have a great power of destroying Edwards family life.

Mbue has a good ear for dialogue and I found her central four characters convincing. After a cousin recommends Jende for a chauffeur job, we get an interesting juxtaposition of two families leading almost completely opposite lives. Jende and Neni have little in the way of material possessions, but enjoy strong family bonds and a good relationship. Jende's employer, Clark Edwards, has his Lehman Brothers banking career to thank for his personal wealth. His family lack for nothing in a material sense, but are sadly dysfunctional from an emotional perspective. Money cannot always buy happiness?Unfortunately, from this strong start, I became increasingly more disappointed as Behold The Dreamers progressed. The narrative struck me as frequently too light and superficial for its themes and I felt uncomfortable with Jende's asylum application being fraudulent and this blithely portrayed as the normal route. In the present near-hysterical political climate regarding migration, refugees and asylum, I think a more responsible approach to the topic is needed. Propagation of the 'all immigrants are liars' myth doesn't help anyone.The psychological effects of Jende's immigration battle are what particularly drives Mbue's story. As readers we see very little of the bureaucratic process itself, but can understand how the stress affects his temper and divides his family. I didn't find many of their actions actually believable towards the end of the novel though and Neni's passivity is infuriating. Overall, Behold The Dreamers is nicely written and did hold my attention throughout. I liked the range of characters and the evocation of New York, but I would have liked a deeper exploration of this emotionally charged and politically sensitive subject."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.237555"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.237555"]]

Endlich hat er seiner Heimat in Limbe, Afrika, entfliehen können, um in Amerika, besser noch, in New York City Fuß zu fassen, Geld zu verdienen und endlich, endlich 'jemand' zu werden. Das ist nämlich Jende‘s eigentlicher Auswanderungsgrund, nicht die Angst vor Verfolgung, Folter und Strafe, sondern vor Perspektivlosigkeit und der Angst davor, den eigenen Ansprüchen nicht gerecht werden zu können. Alles scheint Jende nun möglich, in diesem Land der Träume, das ihm so magisch, fast schon zauberhaft vorkommt. Doch wie schwer es wirklich für ihn, seine Frau Neni und seinen Sohn Liomi werden wird, kann Jende zu Beginn nicht einmal annähernd erahnen. Sehr schnell müssen Jendes Träume einer harten Realität weichen. Sein Asylantrag steht auf der Kippe, das Geld ist knapp und irgendwie, so richtig wohl und ‚angekommen‘ fühlt er sich auch nicht, in dieser riesigen, anonymen Stadt. Neni hat dahingehend zwar weniger Probleme und verfügt sogar über ein Studentenvisum, aber auch ihr werden alles andere als kleine Steine in den Weg gelegt. Nicht zuletzt von Jende selbst. Zum Glück findet dieser nach langer Suche wenigstens eine Anstellung als Chauffeur bei dem Banker Clark Edwards, der wiederum für Lehman Brother’s arbeitet und Neni daraufhin – neben ihrem anderen Job als Pflegerin - als Hausmädchen für die Edwards einstellt. So lernen sich beide Familien, die Jongas und die Edwards, kennen. Ihre Leben beginnen sich miteinander zu verknüpfen, aber auch ihre – sehr unterschiedlichen und doch wiederum ähnlichen – Probleme um Geld, Arbeit und Familie verweben sich. Geheimnisse kommen ans Tageslicht, von denen Jende und Neni lieber nichts gewusst hätten. Beide werden von den Edwards, Jende vor allem von Mr. Edwards und Neni von Mrs. Edwards, immer mehr und immer tiefer in deren private Angelegenheiten hineingezogen - dass das nicht gut gehen kann, ist abzusehen. Als es dann noch zur großen Finanzkrise unter dem Zusammenbruch der Lehman Brother’s kommt, scheinen alle und alles zu kapitulieren. Nicht nur der Finanzmarkt, sondern auch die Ehe der Jongas und die der Edwards.Imbolo Mbues Roman „Das geträumte Land“ ist ein kraftvolles Debüt. Kraftvoll nicht nur vor Sprache und Ausdruck, sondern auch des Inhalts wegen. Man mag denken, Jendes Geschichte sei eine „typische“ Einwanderergeschichte, vom Tellerwäscher zum Millionär, Amerika macht‘s möglich. Oder auch: Vom Immigrant zum perspektivlosen Arbeits- und Obdachlosen, ohne Ziel, ohne Plan, ohne Zukunft. Beides hat man schon oft gelesen oder in Filmen gesehen, beide Möglichkeiten wirken dadurch irgendwie schon bekannt, vielleicht sogar uninteressant. Doch man merkt schnell, dass es sich bei „Das geträumte Land“ um mehr als nur das handelt. Die Geschichte um Jende wird mit der seines Arbeitgebers verknüpft. Beide Familien, seien sie auch noch so unterschiedlich, haben Träume, Ziele und müssen lernen, mit dem Schicksal umzugehen, was da auch kommen mag. Jende und Mr. Clark wollen beide als Männer „wer“ sein, sie wollen ihren Familien, ihren Frauen ein sorgenfreies Leben bieten. - Neni und Mrs. Edwards leben beide im Schatten ihrer Männer, die eine, weil sie es in ihrer Kultur so gelernt hat und es ihr schwerfällt, gegen die Entscheidungen ihres Mannes aufzubegehren, die andere, weil sie persönlich so getroffen ist, dass sie es nicht schafft, sich von ihrem Mann zu befreien. Hinzu kommen die Angst vor der Ausweisung bei den Jongas und der psychische Druck sowie die Angst vor dem Versagen in beiden Familien. Das Buch lebt von Mbues Erzählkunst, welche dem Leser beide Familien sowie deren Sorgen und Nöte auf unglaublich authentische Art und Weise nahebringt und noch dazu von den gängigen Klischees und der ‚Alles-wird-gut-Happiness‘ abweicht. Mbue beschönigt nichts. Sie bleibt realistisch und das tut dem Roman richtig gut. Dadurch fühlt sich der Leser nicht an längst gekannte, zigmal gelesene, ähnliche Geschichten erinnert, die irgendwie nach Traumtänzerei klingen, sondern er bekommt tatsächlich ein Gefühl dafür, wie es sein muss, als Auswanderer vor einer schier endlosen Mauer an Unüberwindlichkeiten zu stehen und gleichzeitig wie verrückt Heimweh zu haben. Zusätzlich zeigt sie, welche Abgründe hinter einer scheinbar heilen Fassade in der Welt der ‚Schönen und Reichen‘ stecken kann, von denen niemand wissen soll bzw. will. Die Autorin schafft es, nicht nur zwei gänzlich unterschiedliche Familien miteinander zu verknüpfen, sondern auch zwei divergente Kulturen und bringt diese dem Leser sogar noch nahe. Der Zusammenbruch der Lehman Brother’s und die Finanzkrise spielen hierbei tatsächlich nur eine Nebenrolle, das sollte vielleicht erwähnt werden, denn auf dieses Detail geht Mbue nur am Rande ein. Das ist aber total in Ordnung. „Das geträumte Land“ handelt nicht grundsätzlich von ‚Reich vs. Arm‘, sondern vielmehr von Träumen, Hoffnungen und Wünschen, die ein jeder von uns hat. Egal ob reich oder arm, egal ob aus Amerika oder Afrika. Nicht immer werden sie wahr und nicht immer lohnt sich der Kampf, aber der Versuch allemal. Mbue’s Debüt überzeugt auf ganzer Linie, vor allem aufgrund ihrer sehr realistischen und nachvollziehbaren Erzählweise, die sowohl sprachlich als auch inhaltlich sofort eine Art Sogwirkung beim Lesen entfaltet und wegen ihrer durchgängig sympathischen Figuren, die alles andere als unfehlbar sind und der Geschichte dadurch nur noch mehr Authentizität verleihen. Eine klare Leseempfehlung für alle Fans von Gesellschaftsromanen und Themen, wie sie aktueller nicht sein könnten."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.242348"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.242348"]]

And then I realized that I haven't read any books by African authors (and I do try to read diversely) and hence this choice, although in all fairness it isn't exclusively due to the author's place of birth. I do really enjoy NY stories and particularly the stories of immigrant experiences. The latter being such a hot topic politically that this book is very timely in helping ascribe a measure of humanity to the situation. The main characters of this story, the eponymous dreamers, are, like the author, Cameroonian. They come to NY of 2007/2008 in pursuit of that ephemeral happiness so heavily advertised and for a while seem to actually get on the American dream train, which later goes off the track to continue the metaphor when the financial crisis hits. And it is then with hopes dashed and plans unrealized the dreamers must decide whether the dream is worth pursuing still. For a debut novel, this is very impressive and most auspicious. I'm not sure how much of her personal story the author put into it, but the experiences, struggles and joys seem very authentic. You can't help but care, cheer and sympathize with the protagonists. The writing is very strong and assured, creating for a very immersive reading experience. There were some interesting juxtapositions, particularly between the main characters and the Wall Street wealthy white family they come to work for and get embroiled with. Not to use black and white analogy in a story like this I suppose would be nearly impossible. The differences in attitude, in mentality, in priorities are just too striking. And in the end it does get resolved somewhat too quaintly (put aside to the first time writer) with a message of family first being handed ever so heavily. The ending is somewhat frustrating, but it does create a for a good discussion or some serious pondering. After all, most reader have probably never had to deal with similar choices. For me the most interesting thing was the way the characters were changed and shaped by their trials and tribulations to the point of differing quite wildly in ambitions and dreams and yet eventually converging for the sake of family. It's difficult to rate a dream, there are different ways of succeeding just as they are different ways of failing, made all the more challenging by seemingly insurmountable circumstances and the financial crisis of that time is still echoing today. There is something to be said for having the courage to dream though, for taking chances, for allowing oneself enough hope and optimism to try. And so these dreamers are a pleasure to behold.

Who and how much does it harm the country? There are many unsolved immigration problems that need to be worked out. What is moral and immoral? What is the gray of morality?A family from the Cameroons in Africa immigrated to United States. They settled in Harlem. Jende Jonga came to the US for a better life for his family. His home country had no path for someone poor who had to quit school at an early age. He was working so hard to pay the fees of his immigration lawyer. What do a lot of undocumented immigrants do? Work for cash, like washing dishes for restaurants and as working as a livery cab driver. Jende’s wife came over on a student visa. She too had an education cut short but she was determined to be a pharmacist. Neni was a very determined woman, like Jende working hard for a better future for her son. They had a son named Liomi. One day, Jende is on top of the world, he got hired to be a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, an executive at Lehman Brothers. His income rose to $35,000 a year, he felt that everything was possible. His dream of being an American citizen, supporting his family, getting a great education for his son, buying a house in a good neighborhood could all come true. You really want for this loving family to succeed. Jende was surprised to learn as he drove Clark to his appointments to learn of the difficulties looming ahead for Lehman Brothers. It was hard to understand but he knew it was not good. Also Clark would spend time with another woman than his wife. He also heard Clark’s wife on her cell phone and knew that she was not stable. As time went on, interactions between the two families increased up to the time that Lehman Brothers fell. Like a house of cards, the two families fell down.From the first page, I could not stop reading. The writing was beautiful, heartbreaking, bewildering and strong. The contrast between the United States and the Cameroons is great as it was between the successful business man and the man with a green card.

There are thousands of stories to be told, and experiences to be inscribed, and I feel like contemporary literature is only just beginning to embrace the diversity needed to let these writers take centre stage. Which is why I leapt at the chance to read an arc of Behold the Dreamers. It's been compared to one of my all time favourites Americanah and while a part of me really dislikes when novels are compared to each other, another part of me hopes that people who enjoyed Americanah might be persuaded to pick this one up too, if only just because of the comparisons being banded about in the media. That being said, the two books are vastly different. In Behold the Dreamers, the story revolves around a Cameroonian couple who land in NYC just before the Lehman shock, hoping to make a better... or rather, a different, life for themselves. While Americanah, of course, tells the story of a young Nigerian woman in America - there are similar themes in the novels (the American Dream, racism, discrimination, culture shock), the experiences of the central characters are completely distinct. Behold the Dreamers also comes across as much lighter in tone, and in content. There isn't a lot of outright drama, rather a lot of underlying discrimination that runs through the prose. And oh, the prose. How wonderfully Mbue writes. Succinct and languid, she manages to capture the view of New York through Cameroonian eyes, and it sings with authenticity. My one bone to pick with Dreamers is that it felt a little too thin at times. I wanted a bit more heft to the characters, a bit more meat to chew on. The ending did NOT satisfy me, not in terms of the plot twist, but rather because I was left wondering a little bit about what the point of some of the characters were. I will definitely read another Mbue, and I hope her next novel has more tasty tidbits of Limbe life.

It is really difficult to write a book featuring drastically different characters that treats all of them fairly. Behold the Dreamers does all of that and more. It's strange to me that we have so few books about the recession even though it had such a huge impact on the country. Behold the Dreamers through its dual families--white, wealthy Wall Street and struggling Black African immigrants--manages to make all of its characters sympathetic some of the time and frustrating at other times. Jende and Neni are not martyrs or saints, they are fully fledged people with dreams and failings. Likewise Clark and Cindy are not villains, and the more we see of them through Jende and Neni's eyes, the more interesting they become. There is a lot to dwell on here in what the American experience is and how different people define success.

This gave two entirely different perspectives of what the American Dream really is and how its loss, while it may mean different things to different people, truly does not discriminate.

The synopsis about a family from Cameroon was intriguing. I went into Behold the Dreamers knowing nothing about Cameroon except it is located in the same continent where I live ( Thanks to Wold Cup and African sports events ), Well the Cameroonian cultural part was good but I ended up learning so much about other things mainly about America and its immigration system, race, classes, etc. It has so many themes and I got to learn so much about life in Cameroon and was surprised at how much we have in common ( living in north Africa makes you feel so detached from the rest of the continent ). This idea is also examined here Imbolo Mbue describes how Americans think Africa is just one thing \" ah you are from Cameroon, my cousin's been to Kenya \". Also many themes related to family structure , man to woman relationship that I didn't know were very culturally similar. A very good example of what I related to was Neni, an example of the African woman who's working hard to manage it all raises her children, Works and sometimes studies while there's so little prosperity available that may allow her escape one of these things. That made me question my identity as an African woman. Describing Limbe and life in an African small city, food, drinking spots, music scene, all was charming. The American part was the main setting of the book though. New York city 2008 just before the financial crisis where Jende Jonga had his own crisis fighting the immigration system that wanted to deport him. For Jende this equaled getting out of heaven, because America meant everything, it's the American dream and for the most part it shew Jende the ugly side of it. The book starts excellently I liked everything about its first half. The comparison between two marriages. One is Jende and Neni, happy marriage with little money and lots of financial and political problems, the other was Clark and Cindy's an upper class white New York family that Jende worked for as a chauffeur and it's obviously falling. Here's where the story unfolds and reveals a lot of things to do with life in America, immigration race and how this nation is living a post-traumatic racism era and how people from Africa still don't feel comfortable enough around white people who label them, expect them to do certain things, and how People who come from Africa still don't know how to run away from this shaming while African-Americans have gotten over that and don't really give a shit who's around anymore. The collapse of Lehman brothers which Mr Edward worked for and which preceded the financial crisis came to change life for everyone and here's where we see a lot of character development and changes of values and behaviors. It's a really hard to put down book because you really get attached to each character but does this always equal deeply written characters? I am not sure the answer is yes. At some point I thought is this story -which is pretty much plotless- just made up or just faked to be used to document this period of time and all the social and economical changes? but thinking of the first half of the book and so many beautiful emotional moments and how it made you always feel this is a character driven novel I denied this idea. But that doesn't mean all the characters felt so real to me I am definitely not talking about the female characters Neni and her development were more than believable and real. Cindy with all her troubles and complicated past felt real. But Jende, Clark sometimes I felt really detached from them, sometimes I didn't understand their reasons. Sometimes they were perfect as the moment where Clark told Jende he wrote Poems as they witnessed sunset. It took my breath away. I also like Veince and Mighty, the comparison between Generation X and the free-spirited millennials ,who want to get away from their materialistic lives and just go their own way to discover the truth maybe in a temple India, wasn't bad at all. Overall a great experience with so many great elements I was surprised by the Writer quoting Rumi for example.

It has a wonderful coherency to it, an almost magical one, and the narrative proceeds in a fluency which is lovely. The book is abound with several important themes and issues, and raises questions in a dauntless, bold manner. Overall, Behold the Dreamers is a bold and true debut about a migrant family trying to sustain in America.The book is about a couple from Limbe, Cameroon, and what is really interesting is that the author too is from Limbe, Cameroon. That just added on a touch of realness to the anyway brilliant narration, and I'm just so glad I had a chance to read something this diverse and mainly, learn so much from this book.Firstly, if you're looking for a diverse book, you should totally pick this book up. Not just cultural diversity, but even sexual diversity and economic differentiation is so well structured here, it amazed me. I really wanted to put up this review amidst the Diversathon, as my own little contribution (because I couldn't participate) but unfortunately, I couldn't do so. However, end point is, this is as diverse as it gets. It shows a whole bunch of diverse characters, and even beautifully portrays diversity in opinion and way of life. If you are a plot-driven reader, this book probably isn't for you then. It doesn't have a well-defined plot, it's more of a character study. It's highly character-driven, and is based on a basic story (of the couple moving to America). But the rest of the book doesn't have much of a plot (especially the inital 50%) and instead follows the lives and nature of the characters as they develop.One of the many themes of this book is how much family matters, and how far are you ready to go for your family. Family is such an important thing, and we see it through the viewpoint of different classes of people in this book. For rich and for poor, it's the same when it comes to love and family; no matter how much money you have (or don't have) - the lengths to which we can go for the sake of family is astonishing and so truthfully portrayed in the book. We see the characters do wrong, flawed things, we see them make mistakes - all in the face of desperate times.Another one of the themes I loved was how much home matters, and where you comes from will forever have a hold on your heart. It's your home, after all. I love how the story comes full circle, and the ending is so, so satisfying even though it's a bit heartbreaking too. Your roots, the place where you come from will always be there to welcome you back, and the value and beauty of homeland is so well portrayed in the book.Another thing I loved about this book is how the characters are so perfectly and realistically portrayed. We see how good people often do bad things, and it just proves the point that a human being is such a 'grey area'. None of us are completely good or completely bad, we're all good and bad, and that was what I loved the most probably. How sometimes situations compel us to act in ways so out of character, and yet - does that make us bad?The writing was different - it was written in a seemingly emotion-less manner which confused me for a while because the situation of the main characters does spark up a certain amount of sympathy. However, I soon realized that instead of drowning us in emotions, the author instead sets us free to feel things our own way and perceive everything independently. I feel that a lot of authors take on a very sentimental way of writing - deliberately making the writing emotional so that readers can sympathize with the book. However in this book, we have the freedom to think, to feel and to appreciate the book in our own way.Final ThoughtsAll in all, this book is a strong, daring novel and needs to be read. Recommended to : readers looking for diversity, readers interested in African cultural fiction and those who want to read an interesting adult contemporary novel.My Rating4/5 stars"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.364125"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.364125"]]

I had really high hopes for this book, I did. The reviews that have been trickling in seemed positive, the description makes it seem wildly successful, but in the end I feel like I just succumbed to the hype train (again, much too soon- looking at you Sweetbitter). I haven't read Americanah, but I've been told I'd be better off reading that. So if you're wondering if you should read this book and you're skimming reviews (and haven't read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah), just go ahead and stop here. Save your time.As far as the description of the novel, everything plays out true to form. We follow an immigrant family from Cameroon and their efforts to acclimate and Americanize themselves. Jende gets a job as a chauffeur through what seems to be a stroke of luck, but that's about where it ends for him. His dreams of grandeur and success and comfort for his family to me seemed half-formed and idealistic (which is fitting, I guess, because what's dreaming if you can't dream big). Neni, his wife, has joined him in the USA with their small son and her own dreams of becoming a pharmacist for no other reason than 'she wants to be the person to give out medicine'. Okay, sure. Again, dream big. Everything's going well for them, there's a steady build up of success and prosperity- the family that Jende works for (and Neni, by contract during the summers/for events) is generous but self-centered. Sadly, I felt that a lot of the focus on the Edwards family overshadowed the Jongas, who I would have preferred more of. The Jongas are sort of thrust into this acceptance of American culture by way of the Edwards's donations- clothes, toys, money, food. The Edwards are living a skewed version of the American Dream and I think that this sort of tainted the Jonga's view of the country they're attempting to conform to. The Edwards are top tier one percenters, and when the Lehman Brothers collapses in 2008 they life they've been living begins to crumble (and by proxy, the Jonga's does as well). So when Jende is abruptly jettisoned, the Jongas are made to live the life that they SHOULD have been suffering through all along. I say should because he was extremely lucky in getting his job initially, not because I believe that that's what they deserve. I expected way more out of the writing than I got. It was just... fine. Nothing special, nothing made me sit back and go Oh. Just fine. I was upset by the lack of character development, or where it went in the story. I'm not going to spoil anything, but save for maybe one or two moments in the book (that Neni/Cindy scene!), I really despised the main characters or at least the decisions that they eventually made. Okay, maybe not so much Neni but I really hated Jende. He turned into this awful version of himself, and maybe that's the point the author wanted to get across? But I felt so cheated by the characters' decisions only to have it mentioned off hand that- oh, look, this other character totally has a way to solve this problem in a way that's beneficial to you, but it seems like your mind's made up, darn. This happened on at least two occasions in the last third of the book and I honestly can't believe she had the gall to it not once, but both times. I was legitimately upset!Don't get me wrong, there were parts of this book that were like flashes of brilliance in an otherwise subpar, mundane read. It's not worth it for those pieces of writing alone, though. I'm sad because this seemed like it had the potential to be something great, and I feel like I could see glimpses of it, but it never quite hit and it didn't resonate with my like a story I've experienced. It's just something that was told to me, which is unfortunate because I loved the idea of the message. In the end, this one is just another summer flop for me. 2.5-3/5"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.370128"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.370128"]]

Auf der einen Seite die Superreichen mit ihren Hausangestellten, die ihnen jegliche Arbeit abnehmen, in ihren Palästen und Wochenendhäusern in den Hamptons. Und auf der anderen Seite die Armen, die sich in kakerlakenverseuchten Rattenkäfigen ein Leben zwischen Maloche und Existenzminimum einrichten müssen, der knurrende Magen und die schmerzenden Knochen als ständige Begleiter.Diese beiden Welten verkörpern auch Jende Jonga, Immigrant aus Kamerun, und Clark Edwards, reicher Investmentbanker bei Lehman Brothers. Beide begegnen sich, als sich Jende um einen Job als Chauffeur bei Edwards bewirbt, und diesen heiß begehrten Arbeitsplatz auch tatsächlich bekommt. Doch die Pleite der Lehman Brothers macht beiden einen Strich durch die Rechnung.Die Familie Jonga, bestehend aus Jende, seiner Frau Neni und dem kleinen Sohn Liomi, lebt in Harlem, hofft auf ein besseres Leben im „großartigen Amerika“ und bauen darauf, dass durch den relativ guten Arbeitsplatz von Jende dessen Asylgesuch stattgegeben wird. Seine Frau möchte Apothekerin werden, hält sich mit ihrem Studentenvisum nicht illegal im Land auf und gehört zu den intelligentesten in ihrem Semester. Beide haben sich in ihrer Welt eingerichtet und arbeiten hart, um ihr Ziel zu erreichen. Als ein zweites Kind kommt, verbietet Jende seiner Frau weiter zu studieren, obwohl dies ihren Aufenthaltsstatus gefährden könnte. Aber Frauen gehören nun mal ins Haus zu den Kindern.Die Clarks wiederum leben ein Leben nebeneinander her; die Ehefrau Cindy ist eine verzweifelte, depressive Frau, die durch ihre schwere Vergangenheit gezeichnet ist und sich nicht aus der daraus resultierenden Rolle freimachen kann, während ihr Mann von früh bis spät arbeitet und kaum noch Zeit für die Familie hat. Dies wird ihm auch immer wieder vorgehalten, doch er ist der Meinung, der hohe Lebensstandart seiner Familie, der seiner Arbeit zu verdanken ist, ist Liebesbeweis genug. Zwar bricht durch das Platzen der Finanzblase das Unglück über die Familie herein, doch haben sie zumindest in finanzieller Hinsicht nach wie vor ein sicheres und reißfestes Netz.Nicht so die Jongas. Als Jende seinen Job als Fahrer verliert, stürzt er in ein emotionales Loch, und trifft eine folgenschwere Entscheidung. Ist er anfangs noch der liebevolle Vater und liebenswerte Angestellte, bricht im Laufe der Geschichte zunehmend sein männerorientiertes Weltbild durch, das er von zu Hause, von Kamerun, kennt. Solange er nicht fähig ist, genügend Geld zu verdienen, möchte er auch nicht länger in den USA bleiben, auch wenn seine Frau Neni diesen Part übernehmen und nach wie vor mit ihrem Studendenvisum im Land bleiben könnte. So dreht sich irgendwann alles nur noch um seine Bedürfnisse, während Neni verzweifelt. Doch letztendlich ordnet sie sich ihrem Mann unter. Imbolo Mbue hat einen wundervollen Schreibstil; sie erzählt so gekonnt und flüssig, dass man das Buch kaum aus der Hand legen kann. Mit großer Wärme und Kenntnis zeichnet sie ihre Figuren, mit denen der Leser die ganze Geschichte hindurch mitfiebert. Leider hat mich der Schluss dann doch etwas vergrämt, weil durch die patriarchalische Engstirnigkeit von Jende der Lebenstraum seiner Frau zerstört wird.

They marvel together over everyday things and work hard so that their children can have a better life.

The Jonga's thoughts on the Edwards' lives were always unpredictable and fun to read, just as the bizzar habits and attitudes of both families shocked me along. I particularly loved this quote from Jende on attitude in your work (he's talking to the Edward's oldest son who doesn't want to take on his opportunity at an ivy league education):\n  \"I don’t want to be a lawyer. I’ve never wanted to be a lawyer.” “But why?” “A lot of lawyers are miserable,” Vince said. “I don’t want to be miserable.” “My cousin is a lawyer.” “Is he happy?” “Sometimes he’s happy, sometimes he’s not. Is there anybody who is happy all the time? A man can be unhappy doing any kind of work.” “Sure.” “Then why can you not just think you will be a happy man no matter what kind of work you do?”\nIt's quotes like these that litter the novel, as the Jonga's decipher upper-class American life—it's so different from their own. It's sad to see their own lives in Africa discounted by Mrs. Edwards occasionally. Mrs. Edwards, now there was an interesting character. They were all so human, and Mrs. Edwards represents those who are consumed by our problems, who can't move on and think we're entitled to self-pity and an easy life because of hard things. Neni Jonga was her foil—strong, facing her problems head on. Together, they represented the options you have when you react to issues in your life. It's countless other encounters like this that make the novel such an interesting read.The Jonga's have only one perceptible thing standing between them and their goal for happiness: Green Cards. They begin the long process of fighting a legal battle that will drain them: spiritually and financially. They are determined to win:\n  No, he wasn’t going to think about what he would do in Cameroon. He wasn’t returning. That was never the plan. He’d done everything the way he had planned to. He was in America. Neni was here with him. Liomi was an American boy now. They weren’t going back to Limbe. Oh, God, don’t let them deport me, he prayed. Please, Papa God. Please.\nThey begin to fight their battle, and it's a slow, sad decent into hopelessness from there. The immigration process can be brutal, and when a major collapse of the economic system hits New York City, that hopelessness grows, turning Neni and Jende into people they're not.Jende and Neni were so real to me. They had very real (and sometimes horrible) flaws, but that just served to make me love them more for their humanness. A personal look at what coming to America means, emotionally and financially, to those who so desperately want to be here.More awesome reviews = http://rantingsravingsbookreviews.blo..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.375765"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.375765"]]

Je dis ça parce que rien qu'en lisant le titre, ça donne déjà le ton et si on s’arrête deux secondes sur la couverture, on peut facilement imaginer le dépaysement que nous promet ce magnifique roman avec la famille Jonga qui décident de quitter le Cameroun, Limbé, pour vivre le rêve américain. Sauf que voilà, la carte verte est loin d'être facile à obtenir et va falloir trouver une solution pour ne pas se faire expulser. En attendant, on suit Jende, le chef de famille qui se fait embaucher comme chauffeur privé pour la famille Edwards, une riche famille blanche ; toujours avec cette peur au ventre que l'on découvre sa situation irrégulière mais stable, car il est tout de même bien payé, ce qui lui permet de faire d'énormes économies même s'il doit encore rester dans ce petit appartement miteux remplie de cafards. On assiste tout comme Jende en tant que chauffeur privé à la vie de cette riche famille au sein même de la voiture. Entre les disputes, les appels téléphoniques, les échanges avec les enfants, les soupçons etc...Jende se rend compte que l'argent ne fait pas tout et l'essentiel se perd. Pis, nous avons sa femme, Nenie, qui, depuis le Cameroun rêve d'être comme toutes ces femmes américaines qui remplissent les magasines ou qui passent à la télé, quitte à acheter de la fausse marque. La femme du chauffeur doit être au top. Pour elle, il est inconcevable de retourner au pays. Mais à côté de ça, Nenie, ne s’éloigne pas de son projet d'être pharmacienne et pour ça, suit des cours intensifs à l'université. D'ailleurs, elle fait partie des meilleurs. Et enfin, il y a Liomi qui commence à être un vrai petit américain. Ils sont tous les trois bien entourés avec les amis africains du quartier. Musiques, ambiance, plus belles sapes, les palabres, la nourriture, tout y est pour ressentir l'Afrique tout en restant à New-york ; mais la réalité va les rattraper et ce rêve américain va les achever. C'est dans les moments de doutes, de peur, que l'on ressent le manque du pays. Quitter sa terre natale en difficulté pour venir souffrir dans un autre avec un parcours épineux, avec le risque de revenir en arrière. J'ai beaucoup, beaucoup apprécié la plume de Imbolo Mbue qui nous immerge totalement dans ce rêve américain, symbole de réussite, qui fascine beaucoup d'immigrés, mais, par là aussi, nous montre l'envers du décor sans cette fameuse green card. Un peu dans le style qu' Americanah de Chimamanda Nzogi Adichie que je n'ai pas encore lu, Imbolo Mbue met en avant la différence des classes sociales et de cultures ainsi que la place de la femme africaine auprès de son époux. L'homme a toujours le dernier mot quoi qu'il dise, quoi qu'il fasse. Mais surtout, l'auteure nous fait comprendre qu'il faut finalement beaucoup de détermination, faire beaucoup de sacrifices et surtout avoir un sacré mental pour s'accrocher à son rêve ; être tout simplement un citoyen américain ou autre, sans cette peur de se faire expulser à tout moment. Alors, oui, ce livre n'a pas été écrit à la légère pour juste passer un bon moment.

I will say, books like this are why we need diverse authors and diverse content. To challenge us, challenge our way of thinking, and try to imagine living a life that is so drastically different from our own. The closest comparison I can make to Behold the Dreamers is Unknown Americans, but, admittedly, they are very different stories. The biggest thing they have in common is that they both give the reader insight into what it is like to be an immigrant living in America, which is something that many of us really can't imagine. Behold the Dreamers is about the \"American Dream.\" As the book opens, the reader meets Jende Jonga as he nervously goes on a job interview as a driver for a Wall Street exec, Clark Edwards. Getting the job would change Jende's life - the $31,000 a year salary would allow him to provide for his wife, Neni, and son, Leomi, in a way he has been unable to thus far, even as he's worked multiple jobs to support his family. Neni, his wife, not only works herself, but is also working hard to put herself through school to achieve her dream of becoming a pharmacist. They've come to America from their home of Limbe in Camaroon, hoping for a better life for themselves and their son. Spoiler alert! - Jende gets the job. And the dichotomy of his life compared to that of his new boss, Mr. Edwards, and his family is interesting to witness. The reader gets to see things through both Jende's and Neni's eyes as the story progresses, which I think is important. Jende and Neni love each other very much, and both really want a successful life in America, but they are very different people. Jende does not like to rock the boat -- he wants to do his job, follow orders, and provide for his family. Neni also wants to do the best she can for her family, but she is not always as willing to sit back and let things happen to her. She's more willing to speak out than her husband, and fight for the things she wants. What is interesting about this difference in their personalities, is that it had me, as the reader, sometimes switching allegiance between them as the story progressed. I would think Neni was completely out of line, but then Jende would do something that I just couldn't understand and I was all about Neni protecting her family and their dreams. In the backdrop of everything is the up-in-the-air status of Jende's asylum application, which would allow him to stay in the United States. His immigration lawyer, Bubakar (sp?) is AWFUL. Just, AWFUL....as the reader, we can see the ride he is taking Jende on, but are helpless to do anything about it. I really just wanted to slap him for the irresponsible, reprehensible job he was doing on Jende's behalf. It was horrible. The fear of being deported at any given time constantly hangs over Jende's head, causing him to worry about his family and wonder how much money and time it will take for him to finally be allowed to live in America freely. He works so very hard to earn that respect and status. During the story, the financial crisis of 07/08 hits, affecting not only Wall Street, but the world. None of the characters in the story are immune to the effects of this economic downturn, and it changes the course of the story for many of them. What's interesting, though, is how timely this story is for today. As immigration news is all over, here is a story about how hard it really is to be in the United States legally, and what an expensive and time-consuming it truly is to secure a life in the United States as an immigrant. And yet, to Jende, Neni, and many, many others --- those efforts are worthwhile because this country offers so much promise and hope for not only their future, but that of their children. It doesn't even matter that the life they live in the US is one in which they are barely scraping by - it is worth it. As someone who was lucky enough to be born in and live in the United States since birth, I can't imagine what it is like to come from a place that doesn't have that promise or hope. How living in poverty in the United States is still better than living in the place you came from. This book was also eye-opening for me in terms of how things are viewed by those of us who have grown up in the US, versus those who haven't. There were a few times, as I read, where Mr. Edwards or his wife would offer up money or designer clothes to Jende or Neni, and they would immediately accept these gracious gifts. There was no \"Oh, no, I couldn't,\" or \"are you sure?\" before they took these things -- they immediately took them, and were incredibly grateful and thankful for these things. At a point later in the book, this is addressed by either Jende or Neni (I can't remember which), where they explicitly discuss this very American way of denying a thing--even a much-needed thing--before finally accepting it. And then it made me feel ashamed for my instinctive judgment of Neni and Jende for NOT playing those games with the Edwards's. The story took a number of turns I wouldn't have expected when I started. And I felt that, overall, the Jonga's story (and even the Edwards's for that matter) was very bittersweet. At the end (view spoiler)[ I thought it was interesting how, even though Jende and Neni were going back to Limbe incredibly wealthy by Camaroonian standards, they still regretted having to give up their life in New York. The opportunity for growth in the United States was better, even poor, than it was to be wealthy in Camaroon. This idea that they would have been willing to give up their families, friends, and hometown just to barely make it in New York city is something I can't even wrap my head around. And yet hard-working dreamers like the Jongas are the ones that some in our country want to keep out at all costs. Embarrassing.

Behold The Dreamers is the story of a young couple from Cameroon trying to build a life in NYC.Jende has left Cameroon with the help of his cousin Winston and one year later he sends for his fiancé, Neni and their young son Liomi. Jende obtains a job as a driver for a Lehman Brother Corp. executive at a decent salary. So, it seems the dream of becoming Americans is about to take hold. But Lehman Brothers goes bankrupt and all dreams are disrupted and interrupted. And not just for this immigrant couple, but for the executive, his wife and their two children as well. Imbolo Mbue covers a lot of territory in this first novel. Obviously, the life of an immigrant family is prominent in the writing, the vagaries of marriage is also a major theme, but as the title suggests the foundation is dreams and dreamers. The American Dream being the paramount dream. Is it every really attainable for immigrants too dark and too poor? And she does a masterful job of examining the American Dream, what is the meaning of it and is it all the same for everyone? Does the idea of becoming an American hold the same sway over all potential immigrants?So, with the writer being from Cameroon and now living in NY, the depictions from both continents are vivid and read authentically. The food, the scenes of NYC, the people, all of it seemed to hit the mark perfectly. Imbolo was able to skillfully write some tension into the story, and my mind was thinking off all kind of crazy summaries . Thankfully, none of what I though would happen did, and I was thrilled and impressed by the ending. I was anxious and nervous that Imbolo Mbue would take a different more dramatic course to conclude this novel.

I honestly recommend this book--maybe a 4.5!Behold the Dreamers is a study in contrasts of the American dream. The Cameroonian immigrants Jende and Neni and their children -- come to America in search of the dream. They struggle continuously. They live in a roach-infested, tiny apartment in Harlem and are continuously confronted with their immigrant status and how it affects their work situation, schooling and keeping their heads above water. BUT, most importantly Jende must figure out how to stay in the US.The wealthy, privileged power couple, Clark and Cindy Edwards and their children are the living the dream--worlds apart--in luxury both in NYC and Southampton. Nonetheless, the Edwards' story is not perfect and not without complications, and thus too is interesting--and they are humanized when they could have been cardboard. I especially loved the parts that depicted Jende and Neni [and their elder child, Liomi] interacting with the Edwards' children, Mighty and Vince. That being said, I pretty much enjoyed reading about the relationships between all the players [and there are more Cameroonians as well.]I was drawn into this book from the start. Though for me, much of the appeal of the book was Jende and Neni's American story--which began in 2007 and continued post Wall Street crash. There were hints at how some things might turn out, but the book continued to be a page turner--not entirely predictable [a bonus]. I did find the rhythm slowed a bit for me for the last 50 or so pages, but...The descriptions of life in Cameroon for Jende and Neni before they came to the US--and the lives of others they left behind and how it impacted them in the US also were interesting and informative. The driving force of the narrative for me, however, was the US story.Congrats to the author on what I think will be a bestseller."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.435844"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.435844"]]

Life if good for all. Then the crash happens. Life becomes hard and the cracks of the wealthy and poor immigrant’s lives are exposed and fractured.From the start I had a sense of dread while reading this book. I knew it would be challenging and it is because the story is a hard and realistic look at lives of the have and have nots in this country. The saying is that more money equals more problems. That is true. But the more money problems are like the obnoxious hashtag #firstworldproblems. The immigrant problems are focused on survival, being able to dream big, crash hard and making it through each day. This book is a fascinating juxtaposition of being able to have anything you want and not being able to pull together the resources to make a dream real. Some can chase happy and others chase rent money. It is also an interesting comparison of the roles of mothers and fathers as influenced by both culture and money.The ending still has me thinking about the outcomes for both families. Depending on your half-full or half-empty viewpoint, it is happy or sad. I found it profoundly sad with a sense of possibility. Life can be hard and forces beyond your control can have great impact on the future. Reactions to life’s disasters have even more impact on the future.I read for two reasons, to learn and for entertainment. Behold the Dreamers is eye opening and will keep me thinking.

This would be a wonderful book discussion book for book groups as well. Jende lands a job working as a chauffeur for a wealthy Wall Street executive while his wife struggles to finish community college so she can move on to pharmacy school. Jende's largest goal is to be able to get a green card so that his family can permanently stay in America, however this novel sheds light on just how much of a struggle it can be to go through the immigration system. You really feel for these characters, and see both of their points of view. Both are flawed, both have dreams (different dreams that sometimes collide), and both love their children and want the best for them. Not only do you see the thoughts of Jende and Neni, but you also see in depth into the wealthy family Jende works for: the complications and corruption big money can create. It's easy to want to write off the Edwardses' as your typical white, spoiled, ignorant rich folk, and yet you also see moments of compassion, interest, and gratefulness shown from employer to employee. I liked this aspect of the novel a lot, in that as a reader you realize how complex the workings of family, career, and marriage are, at every level of social class. By the end of the novel, one considers the meanings of home and happiness, and what is worth giving up in order to gain such things. And the end is great... it shows that America chews up and spits out dreamers, yet those who get spit back out are really being given a second chance at a much better, more fulfilling, and peaceful life.

Behold the Dreamers is the story of Jende Jonga, an immigrant from Cameroon who is in the US with his wife Neni and their son. Jende and Neni struggle to build a life for themselves in New York City while also dealing with the scary reality of being deported back to Cameroon. Jende's visa is expiring and he must wage a legal battle in order to stay in the U.S.The year is 2007 and Jende gets a job working as a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a bigwig at Lehman Brothers who lives the American Dream with his wife Cindy and their two sons. As Jende's employment stretches in to months, the relationship he forms with the Edwards family becomes less defined. Behold the Dreamers was one of those books that gave me endless questions to think about (PERFECT BOOK CLUB BOOK). I finished it a month ago and I have so many unresolved feelings. I usually have pretty clear cut feelings when it comes to the characters I read about, but the way these characters were fleshed out was so flawed and so real, that I find myself desperately pondering their motives. I feel almost unable to judge any of them. They all made horrible, disgusting decisions at times (some of these decisions were much worse than others) but I could see their motivations and understand them in a way that made me more forgiving. I absolutely loved this book, and will definitely count it among my favorites of 2016. The themes and characters are so relevant to today's society.

(σελ. 336) Με τα αισιόδοξα αυτά λόγια της Καμερουνέζας πρωταγωνίστριας Νένι θέλω να ξεκινήσω το σχολιασμό μου για το μυθιστόρημα της Imbolo Mbue «Ιδού οι Ονειροπόλοι» που κυκλοφορεί στην χώρα μας σε μετάφραση της κ. Αργυρώς Μαντόγλου. Η αλήθεια είναι πως πέρασε αρκετός καιρός από τότε που γύρισα την τελευταία του σελίδα, ωστόσο δεν ένιωθα έτοιμος να γράψω γι' αυτό. Ήθελα οι εντυπώσεις και τα συναισθήματα που μου δημιούργησε η ανάγνωση του να ζυμωθούν μεταξύ τους με καταλύτη τον χρόνο κι ύστερα να βγουν στο φως!Πρόκειται για ένα αυθεντικό σύγχρονο κοινωνικό μυθιστόρημα, κατά το διάβασμα του οποίου ο αναγνώστης παρακολουθεί τις προσπάθειες του Γιέντε Γιόνγκα και της γυναίκας του Νένι, μετανάστες στην Αμερική, να οικοδομήσουν γερά θεμέλια για μια καλύτερη ζωή, ζωή η οποία θα παράξει μελλοντικά αρκετές εκμεταλλεύσιμες ευκαιρίες για τον εξάχρονο γιο τους Λιόμι. Η ζωή τους χαμογελά, όταν ο Γιέντε βρίσκει δουλειά ως σοφέρ του Κλαρκ Έντουαρντς, ενός ανώτερου διευθυντικού στελέχους της Lehman Brothers. Ο καιρός περνά, οι οικονομίες της οικογένειας αυξάνονται, ενώ οι σχέσεις με το αφεντικό του σφίγγουν. Ειδικά, όταν η Νένι εργάζεται ένα καλοκαίρι στην εξοχική κατοικία της οικογένειας του Κλαρκ, οι δυο οικογένειες έρχονται ακόμα πιο κοντά! Τόσο ο Γιέντε, όσο και η Νέλι απολαμβάνουν την καθημερινότητας τους, ανάλαφροι από άγχη και προβληματισμούς, ενώ γεύονται συχνά την γενναιοδωρία των Έντουαρντς. Ώσπου, κάποια αναπάντεχα γεγονότα έρχονται να ρυτιδώσουν την ήρεμη ζωή τους...Θα καταφέρουν άραγε, ο Γιέντε κι η Νένι να υπερπηδήσουν τα εμπόδια που ορθώνονται στον δρόμο τους; Για πόσο χρόνο ακόμα η φλόγα του αμερικανικού ονείρου θα σιγοκαίει μέσα τους;Με τριτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση επιλέγει η συγγραφέας Imbolo Mbue να αφηγηθεί στους αναγνώστες την ιστορία της οικογένειας Γιόνγκα, αφήγηση που άλλοτε εστιάζει στη Νένι, κι άλλοτε στο Γιέντε. Μία ιστορία πολύ οικεία για την ίδια, η αφήγηση της οποίας θα μπορούσε κάλλιστα να αποτελεί μία αυτοβιογραφική αναφορά. Κι αυτό γιατί η Imbolo Mbue με καταγωγή από το Καμερούν μετανάστευσε -όπως κι οι ήρωες της- στις ΗΠΑ. Μία ιστορία που ίσως και για μια μεγάλη μερίδα του αναγνωστικού κοινού να αποτελεί κάτι το σύνηθες, μιας και έχουν γραφτεί αρκετά μυθιστορήματα, κεντρικός άξονας των οποίων αποτελεί η μετανάστευση, κι ο αγώνας αυτών των ανθρώπων να ριζώσουν στο νέο τους τόπο. Ωστόσο, νομίζω πως το «Ιδού οι Ονειροπόλοι» είναι ένα ανάγνωσμα ξεχωριστό! Ανάγνωσμα που μπορεί να θίγει παρόμοια ζητήματα, αλλά διαφοροποιείται απ' αυτά λόγω του ότι η συγγραφέας καταφέρνει να πλάσει με έναν αφηγηματικό τρόπο τόσο λιτό, προσιτό κι ανθρώπινο μια εξαιρετικά αληθοφανή ιστορία, τα γεγονότα της οποίας ενδέχεται να προβληματίζουν καθημερινά πολλούς ανθρώπους γύρω μας, που αποφασίζουν να μεταναστεύσουν στις ΗΠΑ.Η συγγραφέας συγκεκριμένα καταφέρνει επιτυχώς να αποστασιοποιηθεί από το λογοτεχνικό της έργο και να περιγράψει δίχως μελοδραματισμούς, συναισθηματικές υπερβολές, αλλά και χωρίς να κάνει χρήση ενός βαρύγδουπου λεξιλογίου, που να αγγίζει τα όρια του βερμπαλισμού και να δημιουργεί αποστάσεις, τη συναισθηματική κατάσταση των ηρώων, η οποία κάθε τόσο μεταβάλλεται, αφού συχνά η ζωή τους έρχεται αντιμέτωπη με νέα γεγονότα, η εμφάνιση των οποίων δρα καθοριστικά στην εξέλιξη αυτής. Διαβάζοντας κάποιος το μυθιστόρημα αυτό θα μπορούσε να πει πως τα συναισθήματα των χαρακτήρων δεν εκφράζονται με τρόπο άμεσο, μιας και δεν αφιερώνεται μέρος της έκτασης του βιβλίου στην περιγραφή των σκέψεων και των συναισθημάτων που ταλαιπωρούν τους ήρωες, αντίθετα η συγγραφέας καταφέρνει να μας τα κοινωνήσει μέσω του τρόπου που ενεργούν αυτοί στην καθημερινότητα τους, γεγονός που αποτελεί μία ενδιαφέρουσα ιδιαιτερότητα του βιβλίου.Ο αναγνώστης σελίδα τη σελίδα, απ' τις πρώτες κιόλας αράδες του μυθιστορήματος διανύει την απόσταση που τον χωρίζει από τους ήρωες, γίνεται σάρκα από τη σάρκα τους και βιώνει μαζί τους κάθε αναπάντεχη εξέλιξη που τους επιφυλάσσει η ζωή, με αποτέλεσμα να καλλιεργούνται μέσα του τα συναισθήματα που επιθυμεί η Imbolo Mbue να του μεταδώσει. Ειδικότερα, ο αναγνώστης γεύεται την απαράμιλλη χαρά του ζευγαριού όταν ο Γιέντε βρίσκει μία αρκετά καλοπληρωμένη δουλειά. Ενθουσιάζεται με τις εμπειρίες που αποκομίζει τόσο ο Γιέντε, όσο και η Νένι από την συναναστροφή τους με τον Κλαρκ και τη σύζυγο του, καθώς και με την γενναιοδωρία τους. Προβληματίζεται με τις αλήθειες που κρύβονται πίσω απ' τις κλειστές πόρτες της οικογένειας Έντουαρντς, ενώ σοκάρεται με τη συμπεριφορά της Νένι όταν η τροπή που 'χει πάρει η πορεία της ζωής τους στην Αμερική φαντάζει δυσοίωνη και άμεσες αποφάσεις πρέπει να ληφθούν για να μην κατρακυλήσει.Η Imbolo Mbue φέρνει τους ήρωες της και κατ' επέκταση τον αναγνώστη αντιμέτωπο με το ζήτημα της μετανάστευσης στις ΗΠΑ -που μέχρι και σήμερα αποτελεί μία χρόνια κι επίπονη ψυχικά διαδικασία- καθώς και με τα άγχη, τους προβληματισμούς και κάθε είδους δυσκολία που την συνοδεύει. Παράλληλα, μέσα από το βιβλίο της η συγγραφέας αναφέρεται στο θεσμό του γάμου και γενικότερα στην οικογένεια και μας παρουσιάζει με τρόπο πραγματικά παραστατικό, αφού το βιβλίο είναι πλούσιο σε διαλόγους, τη φθορά που μπορεί να αντιμετωπίσει μία τέτοια σχέση, όταν δυσεπίλυτα οικονομικά προβλήματα της κλείνουν το δρόμο κι η πραγματικότητα έρχεται άκαμπτη κι αποφασισμένη να γκρεμίσει όλα εκείνα τα όνειρα, όνειρα κοινά, πλεγμένα με νήμα την ελπίδα για ένα μέλλον φωτεινό, ανάλαφρο κι ευτυχισμένο.Κι όμως παρόλο που αναδύονται συνεχώς στην καθημερινότητα του Γιέντε και της Νένι ποικίλες δυσκολίες, όπως η λήξη της πράσινης κάρτας κι η κρατική διαδικασία της απέλασης, που βρίσκεται σε εξέλιξη, παρόλο που το γνωστό σε όλους μας «αμερικάνικό όνειρο» ξηλώνεται σταδιακά κι η Αμερική φαντάζει κάπως σκληρή, η συγγραφέας καταφέρνει να διατηρήσει ανέπαφη απ' όλα αυτά τη δική της πίστη στο αμερικάνικό όνειρο και να μας μεταδώσει, ξεπερνώντας η ίδια όλα τα προβλήματα με τα οποία έρχονται αντιμέτωποι οι ήρωες της, ψήγματα ελπίδας κι ένα διόλου ευκαταφρόνητο αίσθημα αισιοδοξίας, που υποβόσκει στις σελίδες του έργου της.Ολοκληρώνοντας, το «Ιδού οι ονειροπόλοι» είναι ένα μυθιστόρημα γλυκόπικρο σαν τη ζωή. Ένα μυθιστόρημα που διαβάζεται απνευστί και υμνεί την καθημερινή προσπάθεια των ανθρώπων αυτών που αποφασίζουν να κάνουν το μεγάλο βήμα και να μεταναστεύσουν. Είναι ένα μυθιστόρημα που καλλιεργεί την ελπίδα, την αισιοδοξία, αλλά και την πίστη στα όνειρα!

I was easily drawn into this story mainly because of the Jongas. They have an optimistic (and probably idealistic) view of their opportunity in America and an earnestness about ensuring they take advantage it that immediately endeared them to me. I was rooting for them. And, I appreciated the larger points Mbue makes about the difficulty of legally immigrating to America, the appeal of America to immigrants, the ripple effects of the 2008 financial crisis, and how people’s lives can be tossed into chaos even when they’re doing everything right. I also appreciated her focus on the entrenchment of social status as a pre-requisite for success and how little opportunity women have to choose their own paths in countries like Cameroon.The publisher’s blurb describes Behold the Dreamers as “compulsively readable” and I agree that it was easy to read, but I wanted more out of the writing. Had the social commentary on an immigrant’s view of America, the immigration process, and the Jongas’ wealthy employers been a bit more unique and dazzling, it would have pushed this book to the next level for me.Visit my blog, www.sarahsbookshelves.com, for more reviews."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.487729"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.487729"]]

So relevant to what is happening right now in 2016.

Working as a chauffeur for a business executive, Jende Jonga can't believe his good fortune. He approaches his job with diligence and care, swearing to give his all to his Wall Street employer. When his employer puts Jende in an awkward position, he still pledges to remain loyal to his boss. Jende's devotion may become his undoing and as a reader, you can't help wanting the best for this sincere individual.I loved this story from beginning to end and found all the characters to be authentic and true.

I loved this book and could not put it down! I would rate it a 4.5 or more. This book was about two families at two different ends of the financial spectrum in New York City: an immigrant family from Cameroon trying to put food on the table and surviving while also working over 12 hour days and an upscale family of an investment banker at Lehman Brothers who has a home on Park Avenue and a summer home in the Hamptons. Throw in the financial meltdown of 2006, the hardships of an immigrant family hoping for a chance to achieve the American Dream, and you've got an incredibly riveting story of survival, births and deaths, struggles and triumphs, hopes, shattered dreams and new beginnings. A stunning, excruciatingly realistic and beautifully written debut novel.

For the first time in a long love affair, she was afraid he would beat her. She was almost certain he would beat her. And if he had, she would have known that it was not her Jende who was beating her but a grotesque being created by the sufferings of an American immigrant life.\" (Neni, 237)I picked up this book immediately after finishing the Wangs vs the World and the two definitely go together although this one has less of a lighthearted feel to it in regards to immigrants, the American Dream and the Great Recession. However though this novel is less satirical or amusing, it also serves up a atypical literary immigrant story. It avoids the normal 'struggling immigrants who envy their wealthy and extravagant employers who are secretly miserable' trope, \"How could anyone hve so much happiness and unhappiness skillfully wrapped up together? Neni wondered\" (157). There is a lot of that but the novel digs deeper by showing how the characters change and ultimately switch identities, in a way. There is a warmth throughout the novel although the ending was depressing for me (due to Neni, for Jende I think it was the right choice, which is typical. The man's happiness comes at the expense of the woman's dreams) for the most part the author handles the characters with great care and affection even when their life takes a tough turn and they make cringeworthy decisions. Not only that but the Jongas are naive and full of sunny optimism; your heart aches when Neni expresses how excited she is to be in America where Black people live like the Cosbys. Furthermore the author takes the reader through all the intricacies of the immigration system, the different ways to become a citizen, how people overstay their visas, what options are available to them. This on top of managing to explain how the financial crisis came about because of Lehman Brothers. Plus I knew nothing about Cameroon so I'm glad the author spent a good deal of time explaining why the Jonga family left for America but without spitting all the information out at once. The problems of Cameroon emerge gradually and naturally through flashbacks and conversation instead of through an awkward monologue given by a character. Additionally there is great detail given to Jende's job as a chauffeur, a job I don't think many people know much about aside from a vague sense of 'they drive people around'. However I am not sure I can say I liked the Edwards family, their white privilege is glaring to me throughout the book. The author develops the family but it was still frustrating to see that they got away without being seen as true villains by the Jongas even though they screwed them over time after time but then weaseled their way into forgiveness.The dialogue is pitch perfect, soundly capturing the idiosyncrasies of America and those who live here. It's difficult for me to come up with anything I truly disliked about this novel from a critical perspective. I wish we had been given more of a backstory for Winston, I wanted to better understand how he achieved success (was it just a matter of the quality of schooling as I think was briefly mentioned?) but aside from that this novel is fantastic. By far one of my books I've read this year. The characters and ending are unforgettable with an ending that will cause a great deal of healthy debate about whether or not you agree with the Jongas decision. For me the novel raised the interesting question of what/who we consider fortunate, are those with long standing generational ties to America lucky or those who are able to pack up and return home when things fall apart the true lucky ones (although not everyone is able to go home)? At the same time, whether or not you agree with the path to immigration they chose and the ending, the novel is a riveting read, never losing its multiple plotlines or its heart."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.551515"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.551515"]]

In the meantime, Clark's elder son is turning his back on the West and immigrating to India to follow his bliss, to the consternation of both Clark and his wife, Cindy.Some items:Jende lies like a rug to get into the country.\"How long do you plan on staying in New York City?\" the consulate had asked him.\"Only three months, sir,\" he had replied. \"Just three months, and I promise I will return.\"...He was leaving Cameroon in a month! Leaving to certainly not return after three months. Who traveld to America only to return to a future of nothingness in Cameroon after a mere three months?After Cindy forces Clark to fire Jende, Neni outright blackmails Cindy with evidence Cindy's abusing drugs and alcohol, for a $10,000 payoff.Jende hires a shady lawyer to convince a judge that he needs to be granted asylum from the murderous attentions of his father-in-law, which is a lie.And when Jonde makes his decision and Neni disagrees, he beats her, in front of their son.They aren't monsters, but these are not the most admirable people you ever met between the pages of a book, either.SPOILERS FOLLOW.Jende decides to return to Cameroon. Between blackmail and their savings they have quite the little nest egg and he has plans to start businesses of his own. I don't know what his marriage is going to be like back in Limbe but he is intelligent and a very hard worker so I'm sure he'll become a successful entrepreneur and a big man locally. It's not the American Dream denied; it's the American dream exported.Neni's dream is totally denied. She can't go to school back home and her plans upon their return consist mostly of making sure she is properly dressed and made up so as to lord it over the women back home who might dare to pity her. Mbue shows us these two families side by side, Jende and Neni and Cindy and Clark and their respective children, and I think part of her intent is to underscore how at least Jende and Neni have a functional, supportive family, whereas Cindy and Clark have anything but. And perhaps that American society began its decline when we became so mobile and disconnected from our families? I don't much like the ending because I felt that when Jende beat Neni, and when she made herself complicit with it, that they were returning to a traditional patriarchal society where the men rule and the women serve. Neni's father absolutely refused to send her to school in Cameroon, which was one of the reasons she was so happy to move to America.My friend Pati recommended this book to me, with the comment that our nation is in decline. By which she meant people used to emigrate here to build a better life, and Mbue is saying they should stay home and build their own better life there. If Pati and Mbue are right, we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the American empire, which was founded and fueled by immigrants. If we're no longer the destination of choice for immigrants, we're done.But no law ever said the American empire lasts forever.This would be a terrific book for a book club discussion."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.554130"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.554130"]]

This book is about so many things: marriage, families, race, class, and all of our different interpretations of how that fits into the American Dream. Jende and Neni are two immigrants from Cameroon living in New York City. Jende gets a job as a driver working for Clark Edwards of Lehman brothers, shortly before the collapse of the company and the Great Recession. Throughout the book we learn increasingly more of the backgrounds of Clark, Cindy (his wife), Jende, and Neni as they interact with each other, at times amicably and at others hostilely. As the family becomes intertwined and the end of Lehman Brothers looms, there are a number of unexpected twists in the book until Jende has to decide if he wants to continue chasing his dream of becoming successful in America, or raise his family somewhat more peacefully in Cameroon. Behold the Dreamers was definitely a great story to follow - it's not too dense of a read and does not get boring. In an interview at the end of the book, Mbue explains how coming to have empathy for the likes of Clark and Cindy Edwards was a whole journey in itself for her, and I agree. How are we supposed to feel bad for this family who seemingly has it all? But as their story unfolds and we see the unhappiness of their marriage and their fraught relationships with their two sons, we're reminded how so many people (especially in the day and age of social media) can look like they have it all - money, love, etc. - when they're actually falling apart. Cindy is a prime example of this, and though her death is tragic, it forces Clark to look at his priorities and make some hard decisions for himself and his family. Similarly, Jende and Neni are looking to \"have it all\" and fulfill their American Dream of being successful and sending their children to good schools and having their own home in New Rochelle or Yonkers, if only Jende can get his \"papier\" first. Their story, which Mbue says is built from what she's learned from other immigrants to the States and their stories, is a raw look of the desperate, heartbreaking measures people will go through to keep their families together in the United States - from finding and clinging to religion, to divorcing only to marry American citizens, and more. I don't think Mbue is trying to make any points about morality by writing this book - as she mentions in an interview, her main goal was to tell the story. In an era with increasingly uncertain circumstances for immigrants from all places, I think it's an important story for anyone to read and empathize with. I would recommend to anybody looking for a moderately paced, entertaining and emotional read."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.576053"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.576053"]]

Nachdem ich etwas gebraucht habe, um das Buch zu mögen, hat es mir dann wirklich gut gefallen. Es behandelt eine Krise, an die wir uns wohl alle noch erinnern können, legt den Fokus aber nicht auf die Unternehmen und Wirtschaft, sondern auf die Menschen, die davon sowohl gleich als auch ganz unterschiedlich in ihrer Existenz betroffen sind.

I’m so glad I had the chance to read this. I really feel that it opened my eyes to some of the struggles immigrants face in trying to remain in the country legally and in trying to make better lives for themselves. That said, I did think it focused a little less on the immigration narrative and the financial crisis than I’d hoped, so I’m giving this book three stars (though I do recommend giving it a read).Jende is an interesting character. He came to America for a better life, and he’s thrilled when he lands a job as a chauffeur for a Lehman Bros. executive, Clark Edwards, and his family. He’s making better money and there’s some level of stability, which allows him to provide for his wife, Neni, and his son, Liomi. He always seems cheerful with this job and is unfailingly loyal to his employer, but there was just something missing for me in his character. Even with his immigration struggles, I just thought he could have fought harder or found a better way to handle things than he did. Plus, by the end, I strongly disliked him and the way he treated his wife, though some of this may be a cultural issue. I don’t like overbearing men generally and hated the way what Neni wanted always seemed to be ignored.I’d also hoped that, even though this was a story about Jende and Neni, we’d get more of a glimpse into the crisis on Wall Street, and while we do get a little of that, it isn’t much. There was much more of a focus on marriage and interpersonal drama than on either the immigration narrative or the financial crisis. In a way, this probably makes sense, because immigrants have the same concerns as everyone else, but for some reason, I just expected more.I liked Neni for most of the book, but after she takes some extreme actions to keep her family afloat, I had trouble sympathizing with her, though I was still outraged on her behalf when Jende mistreated her or told her what to do. I wish Neni had made different choices, but again, she might have been constrained by the cultural norms that were so ingrained in her. It’s hard for me to understand this, as I could never stand by and let someone else make huge decisions about my life, but I think it was consistent behavior for her character, for the most part.Overall, I did enjoy this book, though I felt there was something missing for me. It went quickly and I always wanted to see how things would work out for Jende and Neni (as well as the Edwardses, who definitely had their own share of problems). I gave it three stars because of some unmet expectations, but I do recommend this book. I think it helps give a little insight into the immigration situation for those of us who don’t really have experience with it, and it’s also a good reminder of how alike we all are at a basic level, despite all of our outward differences.*ARC from Random House via NetGalley"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.583496"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.583496"]]

Jende secures a position as Clarke’s chaffeur and it is through his listening ear that we gain access to Edwards’ family dynamics. Both families are following the American Dream…Jende and Neni’s voices are wonderful and give such evocative insight into the stresses of being an immigrant, desperate to retain a job and ultimately a green card. The relationships that develop between Jende and Clark Edwards, and also between Neni and Cindy Edwards, when Neni is given a job minding their nine-year-old son in their summer house, negotiate the power/trust/racism boundary between the master and servant dynamic with empathy and a sense of realism.

The writing is good and keeps you turning the pages which is why 4 stars versus 3, but the lingering taste of venturing into revealing a political side was a detraction that would've been best left unsaid."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.599441"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.599441"]]

A book so caught up in the idea that happiness can only be observed in the distant future.Behold the Dreamers tells the story of the Jongas, an immigrant family seeking happiness, wealth, and a glistening future from an America they thought they knew, but didn’t really know at all. And as New York City swallows them, their lives intertwine with that of a prominent American family, who unravels at a pace nobody could predict. It was so realistically paced that it came off boring. I didn’t find myself yearning to read it for any reason other than to put me and my noisy brain to sleep at night until about page 269. Things began to pick up nearing that point. It wasn’t bad by any means, it was just slow and hard to push through. The writing felt like journalism, like I was reading a very long article about the trials and tribulations of immigrating to the United States. The information was valuable, and I learned more than I can remember learning from one book. I praised the moments I could fit together with things I’d already come to understand, like the subprime mortgage crisis, the historical election of Barack Obama. But it was too trapped in report mode. Too this, this, this, that, that, that. Zero experimentation with how much can be said with one magical sentence. Here’s what I knew about immigration before reading this book: Ellis Island, it’s hard to get a green card, The ProposalHere’s what I know about immigration after finishing this book: A lot I understand the enchantment of the United States. I understand Neni’s desperation at the end to stay, despite how much I wanted to slap the shit out of her. I understand the need to make something yours, to claim the future, to be apart of something bigger than yourself and your hometown. I understand the anger coupled with not being in control of your destiny. I understand a lot more than I ever thought I would, and that’s why this read, however tortuous it seemed, was enlightening.But man, it was a frustrating ride. Each character took a turn being the villain. Clark, Cindy, Neni, Jende. I couldn’t depend on any of them. They all did what they had to do to survive, because despite Clark and Cindy having that American dream of a life, they were just as encumbered by the future. The one thing we cannot deny as an entire human race is that we are all alike when it comes to the unpredictability of our futures. “No, you don’t understand,” she said. “Being poor for you in Africa is fine. Most of you are poor over there. The shame of it, it’s not as bad for you.”I think ignorance was a really big fatal flaw throughout this book. With every character, even the ones that weren’t very important. Neni was perhaps the most ignorant of them all. But I could forgive her, despite her sort of starting the book as the hero and ending it as the villain. She was so mindless when it came to reality. She’d lost herself in a desperate motherhood where her children couldn’t possibly thrive if they weren’t in New York City, which isn’t true. Sure, the quality of life in New York City cannot be denied, but only if you have the funds, if you have the means to live comfortably. For truth, the Jongas weren’t comfortable at the end. Their marriage was falling apart and Jende was breaking himself in half trying to support the family while paying for Neni’s education. Her desperation was as frustrating as it was understandable. She’d become someone else all in the name of this invisible American dream, constantly hooded by a happiness she swore existed right around the corner. She swore just being in New York City was better than being happy elsewhere, and how unfortunate her version of happiness had become. She was a real American in that sense. Only we wouldn’t return home if it meant being perceived a certain way, which was definitely part of Neni’s fear. \n  America, to her, was synonymous with happiness.\nShe was too shadowed to realize that most Americans don’t live the American dream, and those that do don’t appreciate this American dream how others swear they would. To put it plainly, this was a great exploration of what living in a fictional destination will do when you can’t ever be present in the only moment you have: this one. Jende was a peculiar fellow in that the more you got to know him, the less you started to like him. He really was quite despicable, taking his anger with the immigration system out on Neni. I get it though, as someone who can’t control her waves of irritability, it made total and complete sense how savage he became in his moments of guttural fear. You could tell how behind the times the Jongas were from the way they refused to discuss the inevitability of things happening, so as to not jinx it. It was a total testament to how people operate this day and age. My grandparents are never ones to speak about something tragic that hasn’t happened yet that very well might.Clark was a lost cause it felt for most of the book, and Cindy always seemed like she could be revived. But they fell apart in ways that could never be repaired, and their shocking finale bled through the pages in waves of heartbreak and confusion. The sense I got from them, their purposelessness, it was sad. When others forget who they are or never find out, it’s a tragic thing. His life on Wall Street, as suffocating as it was, appeared to be what was giving him air.Neni’s womanhood was a serious complication throughout this novel, especially coming from a place of immense oppression. Her friends she’d acquired along the way came together as a sort of cheerleading squad for obeying the husband, being the perfect wife, so on and so forth. It became quite toxic, and as a side-plot, it was a great addition to the story. It told of the times, how different they were in the separate countries.The author did an amazing job understanding both lives. She expertly managed the glamour of Clark and Cindy’s. She never overdid, or over-explained the grandeur of a room, the lavishness of an outfit. She gave it to us in simple lines and examples of wealth. [...] they sat in silence, the only noise in the kitchen from the sound of high-end electrical appliances. The kitchen floor had grown warm underneath them.There was much to do in the city, and yet the desperation remained among many to be out of it, to be in a place where the mission was pleasure and not endurance, to sit where the air moved without burden and the water went on for thousands of miles, a place like the villages of the Hamptons.[...] with its all-white decor and large windows as if to never lose a view of the sky.And, likewise, she managed simple examples of poverty, so as to make sure it was never forgotten, but not forced to be noticed.Television was on. No one was allowed to make noise when television was on.\"It’s good to have a dentist,” Jende said, imagining how good it would feel to have someone else clean his teeth.We had small moments of clarity from the ever-confusing character that was, Vince Edwards. He was about the only person that seemed to grasp how life anywhere is tough, how a simple shape on the map cannot promise you this fleeting happiness everyone is so concerned with.As the son of Cindy and Clark, I didn’t expect him to be so enlightened. And while the family found his path to enlightenment humorous, he was behind the scenes, observing and making these grossly accurate observations about the suffering of his family, while living in his truth. “And at his age, he still hasn’t figured out his path, which is what happens when you go off pursuing illusions.”I loved how fed up he was. How curious about the world and the desire to suffer for material goods. It was a great break from all the longing and the let down. The book, as far as books go, was depressing. And this is perhaps because it was realistic. Positive things came of it, but after all the exhaustion and pain, they hardly seemed to be enough. We also saw great wisdom in Natasha, the pastor at Neni’s church. She was compassionate and understanding, but still resolute in her position in the world enough to question the choices of others. She was the only strong example of a woman there was. She asked the things I wanted to ask of Neni. Neni grew unrecognizable by the end of the book. Where she began sprightly and wide-eyed, she ended with this narrow vision of the world, and masked all her selfishness as a desire to make a better life for her kids. I needed Natasha there to second-guess Neni, otherwise I would’ve lost Neni as a character completely.Rejoicing with others in their times of joy and your times of sorrow is a mark of true love, Natasha preached at Judson. It shows an ability to subjugate the ego and view one’s self not as a separate entity but as a vital piece of the Divine Oneness. I appreciate the strategic time of arrival this book had to our world. It follows the 2008 election, the recession, and it felt surreal to see it from a different pair of eyes, especially as our world has fallen into a terrible case of them vs. us. We’ve lost a bit of our unity. We’ve lost a bit of our compassion. But the American dream isn’t impossible, it exists but only in those that choose to believe each day is an American dream in itself. Right now, we all need the present moment. We’ve forgotten life goes on."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.824100"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.824100"]]

The writing is very immersing, so when I did actually make time to read it was easy to fall into the story. The character building was consistent and believable, and I could completely understand Jende's change of nature due to his troubles, could completely see how Cindy seemed to turn into a completely different person. The author definitely knows how to turn a phrase, and I'd love to see her write more and go farther.I'm not sure when this was written (it's set in 2008/9), but it's extremely relevant to the current times. With the issues America is currently facing with the great white Cheeto filling everyone's head that all immigrants are terrorists and want to either blow you up or steal your job, this novel kind of makes it's own quiet statement. There's even a scene where they joke that as a celebration they'll go to Trump tower for supper and make Donald Trump cook their food... I don't know if that's funny or sad actually.It was interesting learning more of other African countries' culture, but the feminist in me cringed a lot. Women get a raw deal in general, but African women seem to get no deal at all... you just take what you can get and be happy for it. They seem to be okay with that though, and I guess if they're happy then who am I to say they're wrong... but I can't help but wonder if they're genuinely happy or if it's just because they don't know anything else?Although he doesn't get a lot of \"screen\" time, my favorite character was probably Vince. He's painted as kind of a hippy-dippy disappointment to his family, but I like that he was true to himself and followed his own path rather than the path that was set out for him. He sees through the sham of the \"American Dream\" and calls it out on it's bull... but the thing is, people still believe in it, even though it's pretty much unattainable... and if people still believe in it, doesn't that make it real? It was a pretty good read, and it leaves me with a lot to think about... but honestly, I'll probably forget about it sooner rather than later because it was just kind of... timid? soft? I don't know exactly, but it doesn't make that big of a splash. It has something to say, but it's like the quiet kid in class is saying it while the rest of the students talk over them...

As an immigrant, like every dreamer before and after me, I was determined to make it in this paradise-for-strivers called America. Just a few weeks ago, I felt that I finally realized everything I have ever wanted in life – liberty, freedom and optimism for the future. After all, I am living in the country of a black president who is a son of an African man. And then the election of 2016 ended. Reading this book is therapeutic for me as I slowly retrace my immigrant journey, this time with eyes less dreamy and heart less fluttering. The stories unfolded in 2008 Manhattan. Jende Jonga, an asylum seeker from Cameroon, miraculously received a job offer as a driver for the wealthy Edwards family. This meant that his wife Neni can continue her study for a pharmacy degree, his six year old son can receive a proper American education and he can now pay his immigration lawyer to keep the paperwork moving in the right direction. Jende and Neni sat near Columbus Circle one night when he marveled: “Columbus Circle is the center of Manhattan. Manhattan is the center of New York. New York is the Center of America and America is the center of the world. So we are sitting in the Center of the world, right?” Right! And who doesn’t want to be at this center of the world? In fact, the Edwards was the shining star of such quintessential story of American dream come true. Coming from modest beginnings, Clark Edwards became a top executive at Lehmann Brothers. They lived the most luxurious and glamorous life financed by subprime mortgage gains. As the story picked up pace, the two couples’ lives collided in this crazy year of 2008. Jende and Neni's dream unraveled as they struggled to stay in the country that does not want them, while Clark Edwards watched his world implode during the financial crisis and his wife sinking into abyss of drugs, alcohol and depression. I truly enjoyed the characters of Jende and Neni, because I could easily relate to their hopes and struggles as immigrants and share their love for everything America. Jende said that when he first stepped into an American supermarket, he thought he died and landed in heaven. That exact thought went through my mind when I stood in the middle of Winn Dixie supermarket in Florida. I found the characters of Clark and Cindy Edwards too clichéd and predicable, which paled in comparison to the realism embodied in Jende and Neni. What is the American dream and is it still a dream worth dreaming? This soul touching book will certainly offer clear-eyed truth over disillusion and false hope.

We follow them through the mid-2000s as Jende works as a driver for a Lehman Brothers executive, Clark, while Neni works and goes to school in pursuit of a pharmacy degree. Parallel to Jende and Neni's story is that of Clark and his family: Clark struggles to try to steer his company around the looming financial crisis while dealing with marital problems and a son unwilling to follow in his footsteps. Behold the Dreamers is the story of many dreamers: primarily Jende, Neni, and Clark but also Winston (Jende's cousin, who is an attorney), Fatou (Neni's friend, who braids hair for a living), Cindy (Clark's wife), and Vince (Clark's older son). And the stories of these dreamers are woven together into a beautiful, interdependent narrative that is at times joyous and optimistic and at other times sad--even tragic, and pessimistic.The author, Imbolo Mbue, writes gorgeously engaging prose. She has a great gift for characterization and for conveying the drama and import in the lives of ordinary people. Her novel is deeply honest, dealing candidly with issues of sexism, classism, domestic violence, drug abuse, and xenophobia. She tells us the true stories of fictional people, but because her story is true, it is not the story we were necessarily expecting. (view spoiler)[In the end, Jende and Neni do not find the American dream. They return home, with their two children, having failed to achieve the American dream, but they are--in my assessment and despite Neni's disappointment--still successful: they did not make it in America, but they have a bright future at home in Cameroon, and they have two children who will likely learn much from their parents' experience and do well in life. And Clark's arc is also a failure of the American dream: his son, Vince, has gone to India on a spiritual quest, rejecting Clark's way of life; his wife, Cindy, has drunk and drugged herself to death; and Clark himself has seen his company, Lehman Brothers, go down in disgrace in the financial crash of 2008. Yet Clark emerges from all this with his spirit intact, hopeful to make a better life for himself and his younger son and seeing the folly of his workaholic pursuit of Wall Street success.

Unlike Ifemelu, the heroine of Americanah, who comes from a middle-class family in Nigeria and occupies middle-class spaces in America, Jende and Neni belong to the lower classes in both their African and American homes. Jende drives a cab for a living before landing a job as a chauffeur to Clark Edwards, a senior executive at the infamous investment bank Lehman Brothers.From the point Jende meets Clark, class contrast overwhelms the novel’s thematic concerns;likewise, when Clark’s wife, Cindy, even offers Neni employment as a domestic helper. The questions that arise are plenty: Can people from vastly different class backgrounds relate as human beings? Can they trust each other?Bubbling underneath all this are also questions of love and marriage. The trials and tribulations that Jende and Neni encounter in their relationship, the challenges in the Edwards’ marriage and the comparable but understated patriarchal domination of male partners of their female counterparts in both relationships stand too tall to ignore.Imbolo Mbue has written a magnificently textured work that interrogates several different themes and one of her more admirable traits as a writer is how she manages to keep the thematic threads tied together, making disentangling them into an impossible task. At no point does the reader forget the ways in which the 2008 economic meltdown affected those who lived in the United States and elsewhere, neither is there room to ignore the fact that the lives of Jende and Neni and their immigrant friends in the US are often glossed over in many a debate on migration.Love, class, immigration and the economic crisis are the novel’s four big themes and Behold the Dreamers will satisfy any reader for its ability to cover as much ground as possible in only 382 pages, without being all over the place. There is something for everyone, depending on the hammer they carry. Those keen on religion will find Neni in church, and those who want to explore child-parent relationships have a feast ready for them, too. To read it only as Immigrant African Literature is to do the book a disservice. But then again, we are all allowed to carry our hammers and to find the nails they need to be useful.http://thisisafrica.me/something-ever..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498483394m/35259724.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.921639"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 18:46:21.921639"]]

After reading it, I am grateful to have won it. It is a beautifully written, deep, and thoughtful exploration of the oldest theme in American literature: The American Dream. What makes this treatment stand out is the jutaposition of the dreamers who hope to achieve the dream against the family who already lives the dream. Jende and Neni have come to New York City hoping for a better life. Neni is a strong willed woman who defied her father to marry Jende. She is determined to get an education and a career. Jende was forbidden to marry Neni, and when she became pregnant her father had Jende imprisoned. In 2007, now together and living in Harlem, Neni is in school and Jende has landed a posh job as a chauffeur to a Lehman Brothers executive. They are full of hope for the future. All they need is to become permanent residents.Jende's boss Clark and his wife Cindy are successful, rich, beautiful people, who have come up from the lower and middle classes. In truth Clark is a workaholic whose moral sense must be supressed as he conforms to the business ethics of Lehmans, while Cindy obsesses over fitting in, passing as one of the 1% to maintain her status. As the two couples struggle with their personal demons, watching their dreams unravel, choices are made that will alter their lives forever.I enjoyed this book on so many levels. Mbue is a wonderful story teller, her characters are vivid and unforgetable. The treatment of the immigrant experience and American immigration law is relevent and revealing. I loved how Jende and Neni were hard working idealists about America. The battle between Clark's Midwest values and the realities of Wall Street destroy him while his wife escapes into the oblivion of drugs and alcohol. Cindy and Clark's son Vince understands the spiritual death of American society, dropping out to find a life worth living. I loved the ending as Jende and Clark meet a final time, no longer boss and servant, but as men recognizing their mutual struggle to do what is best for their families.It impressed me that Mbue, born in Cameroon and living in America for ten years, has a masterful writing style and a deep and intelligent insight into the psyche of both immigrant and American.

I regret there wasn't more comparison between their lives, with their respective struggles. Each thought the other was happy, I suppose.There's a lot of Clark's family drama, which had little to do with the story at all, and those parts were honestly the weakest here. I didn't need every line of dialogue with Clark's children to know what was going on.

We had that same theme in this book, but a much more compressed period of time. Our protagonist emigrated from Cameroon, brought his wife and son over too, and is working for a rich Lehman Brothers executive as a driver shortly before that company's financial collapse in 2007. Our protagonist Jende's visa status is undetermined, and his immigration lawyers' skills are also somewhat suspect. That seemed quite realistic, and frustrating. The situation in which Jende found himself, while sympathetic, is also a product of his own making. I thought the title was apt as Jende and Neni were both pursuing the American dream, but it meant different things to them, and what it meant to both of them evolved over time as well, in sometimes frightening ways. This was easily the most interesting part of this book.The four main characters, Jende, Neni, the broker and his rich wife, all seemed realistic, but none of them were actually likeable. There children seemed less realistic and more like stereotypes, and were also not particularly likeable.The writing was beautiful, but the narrative was very choppy. I had no real sense of the passage of time, except for when Neni was surprisingly pregnant and having a child when it would have only appeared a few months had passed. Did Jende and Neni even discuss having another child? Not that I remember. That would have been rather important, I thought, particularly as it left largely unexplored the whole issue of that child's citizenship, in a book about immigration status. What?That, and some other rather large plotholes, left this to be just a middle of the road book for me, but still enjoyable. I'd definitely try something else by this author in the future.

Like the derogatory perceptions the main characters, Jende and Neni, have of African Americans and high regard both had for white folks, who they expected to save them, especially the \"great\" white man Jende chauffeured. What really blew me away was this awful passage: \"The only difference between the Egyptians then and the Americans now, Jende reasoned, was that the Egyptians had been cursed by their own wickedness. They had called an abomination upon their land by worshipping idols and enslaving their fellow humans, all so they could live in splendor. They had chosen riches over righteousness, rapaciousness over justice. The Americans had done no such thing.\" WTF!? Isn't that exactly what America was built on? Slavery and genocide!

To begin with we had a couple from Cameroon seeking a new life in America because of the opportunities the country would afford them and their children. They worked hard to get here and then worked hard to find their places as semi-legit immigrants.We’re told of extreme kindnesses done to the couple and opportunities offered by friends and employers. They’re appreciative and eager to move forward.But then, bad luck occurs (as it does in every life) and we have a total change in attitude and personality with our female lead, Neni. Suddenly nothing anyone does for them is enough for her. She becomes quite vicious and acts in a manner totally unlike the personality that has been established. Not only this but this woman who has been depicted as being very humble suddenly becomes totally obsessed with status and “stuff.” I don’t want to tell too much to give away the ending, but the development of the characters just simply does not hold true. The ending is not supported by the foundation laid in the first half of the book, either.I’d also like to know what the author’s trying to say about the Immigration Dept. Is she saying that they’re inept and fail to do their jobs? Or is she saying they’re sticklers for the law? It’s as though she’s saying one thing in one place and the other in another place.The story started out really well, but then deteriorated and digressed into a mishmash of things that didn’t make sense.

Many years ago I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Cameroon, so it was likely I would enjoy the tale of Jende and Neni Jonga as they try to strengthen their somewhat tenuous foothold on gaining permanent residence in the US and becoming citizens, fulfilling a dream.It's inane to think that simply because Mbue hails from Cameroon she can necessarily write well about her country in much the same way that all not all Texans could prosaically describe the Lone Star State. But Mbue so wonderfully captures the language, the nuances of the language, the cleverness of pidgin English, the saying of ashia after a misfortune--all of that she has down to a T. I felt make in the Northwest Province reading some of the passages.Beyond the language the story too is compelling. At the same time we see the forces and stresses placed upon Jende and Neni as they struggle with work, school, and an uncertain future in the US, we also see those of Jende's boss, Clark Edwards. Clark and his family seeming have it all--cars, homes, wealth-- that is, they are is a position to which the Jonga's aspire, but their lives are also lack some of the foundation that supports Jende and Neni. It is the intersection of these two families' lives that provides much of the tension of the novel.The book is perhaps a little too far-reaching--immigration, the fall of Lehman Brothers, the sub-prime shenanigans, the nature of marital tensions, the sanctuary movement --but the central story of Jende and Neni and the somewhat surprising outcome more than carry the book.

I loved how Mbue used her own Cameroonian roots to develop the main characters in this novel.It is the story of Jende and Neni, immigrants from Cameroon, coming to America for their own American dream. Jende comes to the US a few years before sending for Neni and his son. Neni falls in love with NYC, the flashing lights, ethnic people and access to everything. She jumps right into college to become a pharmacist. Meanwhile, Jende gets a great job as a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, a big-wig at Lehman Brothers. 2007/2008 happen, and we all know what happens to Lehman Brothers. The fall out of the financial collapse is the background of this story.We also get to know Clark's wife and 2 sons. The collapse of Lehman Brothers exposes cracks in both the Edwards' relationship, as well as Jende and Neni's. Navigating the US as immigrants in a country that is fighting to stay financially afloat is extremely difficult, and Mbue documents this beautifully. It is the differences in marriages from one country and culture to another. It is the determination of men and in how they recover from ruin. It is the determination of wives and how they fight to keep what they believe is theirs. It is the difference in humans; how some believe they are handed a lot in life while others scramble to pave their own way.A beautiful, exquisite story from beginning to end.

Through a recommendation from Jende’s cousin Winston, Jende is able to land a job as a chauffeur for a Lehman executive in 2007. He does not have a green card, but his attorney is trying to get the U.S. to grant Jende asylum. Neni has a student visa and is avidly pursuing her education in order to be accepted into pharmacy school.Both of these dreamers are hard workers. Despite being a student and mother, Neni works fulltime. Chauffeur Jende often takes supplemental jobs. But hard work is not enough. Lehman eventually fails during the financial crisis putting Jende’s job at risk; and his incompetent lawyer is not able to get him asylum status. The two of them love everything about the U.S., but the country they love so devotedly doesn’t want them. They might be able to stay if they pursue avenues that ‘destroy who they are’.

Imbolo Mbue's debut grapples admirably with big topics like what constitutes home and the importance of family, but the characters oftentimes rang slightly hollow to me in critical moments of the book. Behold the Dreamers does not gloss over \"the American Dream,\" and does so in a brave manner. The novel offers a realistic look at the cost/benefits of living in America, particularly those in the wake of an economic crisis for those without citizenship. It simultaneously admires and condemns the capitalist urges that dominate this country. Mbue arrives on the literary scene with a nose for the big picture, I just hope future efforts can more consistently nail the minutia.
