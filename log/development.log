Delaney"], ["date", "Jan 20, 2017"], ["review_text", "\n  \"Yes, daddy. Yes.\"\nNo. Please no. I feel like somebody noted the success of books like Gone Girl and the success of Fifty Shades of Grey and thought: wouldn't it be great if we had a book that combined the two? No, actually. No, it wouldn't.The Girl Before failed on so many levels, and I say that as a reluctant fan of these \"domestic thrillers\". I've enjoyed everything from The Girl on the Train to last year's ridiculous but fast-paced Behind Closed Doors. I expected I'd like this one too, but all I got was a weird relationship with \"rules\", another guy called Edward, and transparent twists.The book alternates between the perspectives of Emma (Before) and Jane (After) as they move into the techno-minimalist apartment at One Folgate Street. Though beautiful, there is almost no furniture, absolutely everything is digital, and most bizarre of all - the landlord and famous architect, Edward Monkford, requires that his tenants follow some very strict rules. Both women soon find themselves caught up in a love affair with Edward, but when Jane discovers that Emma died in the apartment, she can't help investigating further.Jane's digging uncovers some disturbing facts about Emma - she expressed concern over Edward's controlling ways to her psychiatrist, her death may not have been an accident, and strangest of all, she looked eerily like Jane herself.Firstly, I don't know what is wrong with these women. Without giving away twists, their behaviour is often outright ridiculous. Warning bells are going off left, right and centre, and they're completely oblivious. At worst, Edward is a murderer, but even at best, he's a creepy weirdo. It's almost comical how much he resembles Christian Grey - not just sexually dominant and prone to \"losing control\" but also strict about Emma and Jane's eating and exercise habits. Ick. Get out. Also, lots of people have a \"type\", but it's just plain weird if your \"type\" are all women who look virtually identical. Secondly, there is no atmosphere. I feel like the author tried to create a \"creepy house with a dark history\" feeling, but it didn't come through because so much of the book was nothing more than a weird romance. I also see how Delaney was trying to create a \"ghost of past lovers\" vibe, but this ain't no Daphne du Maurier. The writing wasn't strong enough to make you scared for the characters, to keep you metaphorically looking over your shoulder.It is often really difficult to distinguish between the two perspectives. I had to keep flicking to the beginning of the chapter to find out whether I was on Emma or Jane. This is partly because the style is impersonal and doesn't deeply connect you with the characters, but also partly because their stories are very similar. As we soon see, Edward takes them to the same places, gives them the same food, treats them the same ways - it was like reading the same perspective twice.And there's a whole bunch of subtle racism going on, as well as a bunch of other distasteful issues. If you insist on only writing about white, middle class people, don’t make the criminals/rapists black and working class. How do you not see what's wrong with that? And casual comments like this (made by a psychiatrist): \"In any relationship there are two repetition compulsions at work - his and hers.\" I can think of a whole lot of relationships where that definitely isn't true.Plus, there's a really poor and insensitive use of rape as a plot device. Without giving away spoilers, someone who was seen to be orally raped is then making jokes about preferring human sperm sacs (to fish sperm sacs - it's a long story, Japanese restaurant, blah blah). Firstly... gross. And secondly... gross.But maybe, even after all of this, I could have been persuaded to up my rating if the ending had provided us with an interesting and satisfying reveal. Unfortunately, I saw it coming from a mile away. The list of suspects is too short; the list of suspects who we'd actually care about it being is even shorter. I'm sorry, but I can't even find anything good to say about it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.560221"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.560221"]]

Is this madness ever going to end? Why can’t a book be left to stand on it’s own merits? I guess it’s my fault for giving in and picking up yet another ‘Girl’ book. Have no fear though, once again, I’ve landed in the minority, as the reviews I’ve seen have been overwhelming positive and apparently it’s being made into a movie. So, take this review with a grain of salt. It’s just one reader’s thoughts and feelings, after all.Point blank - I don’t get it. This whole scenario is strange. Odd. Completely ridiculous. What sane person would agree to live in this situation? Forget sane - why would anybody sign up for this?Maybe I’m the crazy one, but there is no way I would ever agree to give up most of my belongings to move in to a minimalistic stone box of a house that comes with over 200 stipulations. Restrictive and ridiculous rules. Not to mention, answering a bizarre questionnaire and having my “amenities” shut down every time the perfectionistic control freak of a landlord feels like I need to answer yet another series of questions. All in an effort to gauge my “growth” or acceptance of the lifestyle the house demands. I don’t care how good looking or how famous of an architect the owner is; I wouldn’t do it. The author sells the idea by garnering sympathy from the reader for the two women and the excitement of top of the line technology - it's the ultimate smart house. Both women have recently experienced tragedies and need a fresh start. And, of course, the rent for this pseudo stone cell is quite cheap. Hmm . . . I wonder why?The story unfolds through the eyes of the two women - Emma, the previous tenant, and Jane, the current tenant. The story flip-flops between then and now, which takes place two years apart, at a pretty rapid pace. We get to see how their stories mirror each other and it’s a little convoluted at times. More than once, I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose head I was in because I was kind of lost. I liked the whole notion of getting caught up in a story or your past and recreating or reliving that same story over and over. But that’s were the likes kind of ended for me.The entire plot felt like a tangled mess and not one I particularly enjoyed unraveling. Albeit, there was something about it that kept me turning the pages. I can’t say I was wowed though - not by the characters, the scenario or even the twist. I failed to see what so many others have found exceptional about this one.*THANK YOU to Random House/Ballantine Books and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.565367"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.565367"]]

The movie rights have even been sold to Universal with Ron Howard to direct. I didn't know any of that when I first read the description for the book. I just thought it sounded like an entertaining read.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"One Folgate Street in London, is a high-tech minimalist house with so many cool amenities and features that you would figure the rent would be sky-high. But the rent is actually very reasonable.So what's the catch? Well there's no catch really...Except for THE RULES!!Tenants are required to follow very a list of very strict rules. Things like no pets, paying rent on time, no loud noise after 11pm, take out the garbage. You know, things like that...NOPE...not at all like that.There are over 200 rules that tenants MUST be abide by in order to live in the house.To say that the owner/landlord of One Folgate Street is picky about who lives in the house is an understatement. To say that he's a bit particular about his rules for the tenants is putting it mildly. The rental application is extremely long and includes many bizarre (and impossible) questions.\"A person close to you confesses in confidence that they ran someone over while drunk. As a result they have given up drinking for good. Would you feel obliged to report it to the police?\"Is it worth it to live in such a beautiful high-tech home? This home with its awesome hidden gadgets. A house cleaner comes weekly. The lights, heat and cooling will set to tenants personal preferences. The shower will also adjust to their personal settings. Even the air in the house makes you feel better with its ultrasonic - mood enhancing waveforms.\"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary.\"Just don't forget.....the RULES. The main one? NO CLUTTER! Everything has its place, usually out of sight. So no pictures, no plants, no ornaments, no books....wait NO BOOKS???? (OMG!!! that's just wrong!)The owner, Edward Monkford is the architect who built the house. He also lives a minimalist lifestyle. He will not rent unless he finds the perfect tenant. But his need for control goes so much farther than that. And yet... some people are drawn to the \"tormented genius\". But who is Edward really? What happens if someone does break the rules?Emma and her boyfriend, Simon are looking for a safe place to live after a recent break-in. However, their budget is a bit tight and everything is either horrible or too expensive. Then the agent shows them One Folgate Street. She explains the lengthy process for application. Simon is hesitant but Emma feels like the place might be exactly what they need. The rules make her feel secure. She wants to reinvent herself, bring order to her life, to change and be a better person.The house may change her, but will it be for the better?We then meet Jane. After a devastating loss, Jane is looking for new place to live. She wants to make a new start and hopes that One Folgate Street is the place to do it. But it's not long before some strange things start happening. Jane learns some of the dark history of the house and is determined to find out more, especially what happened to the previous tenant.The house may be inexpensive and full of high-tech gadgets, but the walls of the house are also full of secrets. Where is the previous tenant? and is Jane in any danger?\"That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\"This book may not be for everyone. There is a lot of sex. I will definitely say that some of the characters \"turn-ons\" may be \"turn-offs\" for some readers. It wasn't really my thing and I could have done without those parts. However, it didn't really interfere with my enjoyment of the rest of the book.The chapters alternate between THEN and NOW and are narrated by Jane (NOW) and Emma (THEN). I flew through the pages. Occasionally I had to flip back to double-check whether it was Emma or Jane but most of the time I was able to keep up. The story may have been hard to believe and far-fetched at times, but I decided to try to go with the flow and enjoy it...In the end I really liked this novel. I was pulled and it got right inside my head. I had to know what was going to happen! A thrilling story about a house I would NEVER want to live in, (seriously I could not handle any of the rules) but I sure enjoyed reading about it.P.S Put your shampoo awayThank you, Ballantine Books for providing an advanced copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.568141"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.568141"]]

It is an example of extreme minimalism and incorporates the latest home technology. It was originally designed by the techno-architect Edward Monkton as his family home but his wife and son died there which means its now available for others to live. Only there is the slight problem of over 200 conditions that have to be adhered to by whoever lives there. And they have to be interviewed and approved by Monkton personally. The narrative focuses on Emma from the past, and Jane in the present. Both are troubled women. Emma was held at knife point by burglars and she is struggling to come to terms with this. This event drives her decision to apply to live in the house, despite her boyfriend, Simon's reservations. The conditions for residing there will turn her into a new person with more control, Jane has had a stillborn baby and grieving. This house will be her new start and she just happens to fancy the architect. She is receiving a flower delivery of gentians which she assumes is from the architect until she reads the card....and realises there is more to the house than she thought. Emma died in the house.A concerned Jane begins to investigate Emma, the girl before to ascertain whether she was murdered, and if so by whom. There are uncomfortable similarities between her and Emma. From both resembling Edward's wife, to having a no strings attached affair with him which runs a similar if not identical course, to both having risque sex. Jane meets the people in Emma's life including Simon, the aggrieved boyfriend, and Carol, the therapist. Meanwhile, the house appears to develop an entity of its own as strange and random things happen. Is the controlling and manipulative Edward a killer? Is Emma a reliable narrator? An air of menace hangs over the house as danger begins to close in around Jane. The writing is lucid, sparse and beautiful. Pretty much like the house, and there is an air of claustrophobia in the story. This is a house with tragic beginnings and a strong character that is destined to trouble those who live there, you can just feel this. It is a good psychological thriller that keeps you reading without ever losing interest.

The perfect house will help people reach levels of perfection they never thought they could achieve. This is the house located on One Folgate Street. The Girl Before tells the stories of Emma and Jane, two occupants who lived in One Folgate.. Emma died under mysterious circumstances while living in One Folgate Street, and Jane is the current occupant. Both women look alike, and both were involved with Edward Monkton, the architect and mastermind behind One Folgate Street--both also happen to bear an eerie resemblance to Edward’s deceased wife. Jane begins to investigate Emma’s death, and by doing so, puts herself in danger.While the premise was interesting, it felt like the author was trying to cram pieces into a puzzle that didn’t fit. As a result, everything unraveled and it all became a little ridiculous.

And that wheel keeps turning and turning throughout the entire story. Some days that wheel grinds in the down and dirty. Some days it revs up speed and gains relentless traction.Emma Matthews lives in the \"once upon a gruesome time\". Her spin in the wheel is entitled \"Then\". Emma and her boyfriend, Simon, are desperate for a safe haven after Emma is attacked in their present apartment. Fear makes you snap at quick decisions. Desperately, they apply for residency at a slick, state-of-the-art building. Even all the mind-blowing questionaires and restrictions don't deter them. No books (Ah, c'mon now!), no cushions, no placemats, no personal items left out. And they sign on the dotted line.Edward is the award winning architect and owner of this granite luxury edifice. He lost his wife and young son in a freak accident not long before. Living in Japan for a time afterwards, Edward returns to manage his property. And manage he does......quite to the nth degree.Jane Cavendish resides in the time slot entitled \"Now\". She will be the latest occupant of One Folgate Street. She recently gave birth to a stillborn little girl and has been devastated by the loss. Jane, too, is seeking solace behind the walls of this highly efficient building. Although this \"covenant\" seems highly imposing and limiting, Jane signs on the dotted line as well.Soon Jane begins to connect occurrences in her present situation to those of Emma in the past. Things just don't seem to add up. What actually happened to Emma?The Girl Before will be made into a movie by Ron Howard. It brings to mind a Julia Roberts movie (1991) called Sleeping With the Enemy. Remember how the canned goods and spices had to be stacked just so and the towels primly arranged on the rack? Oh, sweetheart, this is just the beginning......The Girl Before is one sharp-ended story that reaches deeply into the slightly tilted minds of its characters.

A thriller has not made me this excited since Megan Miranda's All the Missing Girls. The story is told in alternating chapters between Emma, the girl before, and Jane, the current tenant of a very unique flat. While both women are searching for a living situation within their budgets in expensive London, their brokers both mention a possible solution. One Folgate Street has been designed by an architectural genius, Edward Monkford, but in order to live there, one must pass a series of vetting including a multi paged questionnaire and interview. This is where things just begin to get weird. I fear saying much more will give away the twists and turns within these pages. (As an aside, Emma's chapters are told without any quotation marks in the dialogue. While it takes some time to getting used to, it is very effective in differentiating between the two women's chapters. However I am completely curious as to why the author chose to use this device, if anyone knows, fill me in.)I thoroughly enjoyed how the author portrayed One Folgate - the apartment itself takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story. There are multiple triggers within this book. I feel if I mention them here, they would be spoilers. So. Pretty much, if it's a trigger you can think of, it's here. Reader be warned!I've heard this author is writing under a pseudonym, and I am completely curious as to who masterminded this intricate story.

Then there are the other rules - hundreds of them, seemingly waiting to trip you up, catch you unawares. There are also regular questions to answer, very personal and intrusive questions.

She soon discovers that Emma met an untimely death in the house, and begins investigating just what really happened there.The narrative certainly kept my attention, I really wanted to know what happened to Emma, but I found it hard to believe in Edward, AND his rules, so really that stopped me from rating this one any higher.*Thank you to Netgalley amp; Quercus for my ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.617428"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.617428"]]

By ‘‘manipulative,’’ I mean you’re more than pushed into liking specific characters and disliking others. So you do that. But despite having your thoughts about characters shaped by the author, you’re still manipulated some more as the story progresses. I don’t exactly like when that happens. I prefer to be exposed to all facets of someone’s personality and then be able to decide for myself who deserves justice and who doesn’t. This mystery novel is engrossing, despite it not giving us the liberty of making our own opinions on the protagonists and antagonists until the very end. The short chapters surely had their role to play in my being unable to put this book down.It’s slow, partly because it’s a mystery novel. If you’re familiar with the genre, you know that these types of novels take time to pick up because it’s all about the building part. It takes time for Jane to discover someone died in the house and it takes time for Emma to feel scared. That’s when things really become interesting.The death thing confused me, since I thought real estate agents were supposed to disclose info like that – especially when the previous tenants have died. But I guess there are places where no such law exists. Bummer, but it worked in the author’s favour. I enjoyed seeing this book shift from mystery to psychological thriller. I’m definitely the type to enjoy action in my plots, so I couldn’t do anything else but welcome the darker side of THE GIRL BEFORE, even if it takes time to reach that point. The characters also take time to become important in the reader’s eyes; most likely because they seem so normal, but that’s probably done on purpose to give the effect that this kind of story could happen to you or me. Anyone at all. But don’t worry; it’s very, very unlikely. Sleep tight now.

It was built by a techno-minimalist architect named Edward Monkford. There is an intense 200-question application, a face-to-face interview with the ones Edward personally approves, and even then..they rarely get the lease. And if you do, you have to live by strict rules and adapt to this minimalist lifestyle. It is all in the contract. Things like no children or pets, no curtains or rugs, everything must be put away at all times (including dishes, clothes, etc), no books, nothing left out on floors, no flatbed furniture, etc. Plus you’re required to keep the same cleaning service on, must open the house to visitors for architecture tours, and must take assessments every month to see how you change throughout your stay at One Folgate Street.Not my cup of tea to live under such a strict lifestyle. The two women in this story both went through a trauma before needing to find somewhere new to live on a budget. And One Folgate Street is a house that allows for people to live beyond their means (in terms of rent). Emma and Simon recently had a break in, so Emma needs to feel safe. Emma is the girl from then.And Jane’s chapters are marked now. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is reeling from the loss. For Jane the house feels like it could be a fresh start.

I’m just looking at how it worked into the plot and some scenes felt like added length as they added nothing to the story.The ending felt somewhat tame, though it was still satisfying. I guess it wasn’t as explosive as I was hoping. I liked the random application questions that were thrown in the story sporadically.

The sampler measured in as 17% of the total book, which is quite lengthy portion and definitely had my intrigue piqued. There are so many physiological thrillers available today that sell themselves as in the style of Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins. Very few actually come close to living up to the powerhouses in this genre. This book, however, deserves to sit beside them. This dark and brooding tale was alive with emotion and drew the reader into the tension of the tale. The story wasn't set out in chronological order and this provided room for the tale to slowly unfurl, and share its secrets with the reader at its own pace. The telling of the tale, as well as the setting of it, were as alive as the characters, and all three worked together to provide something suspenseful, shocking and totally unique!First ReadingI received this in exchange for an honest review from NetGalley. Thank you to the author, J.P. Delaney, and the publisher, Ballantine Books, for this opportunity.I have never read a sample of a book before and, to be honest, have never been interested in doing so. When I received an email proclaiming that I was eligible for a portion of this book I downloaded it to my Kindle without any real idea of when or if I would get to it. One day, however, I found myself short of time and eager for a quick read to finish, which is how I ended picking this up.I was hooked from the very first page! This sample contains a considerable quantity of the book, containing approximately twenty short chapters, and I flew through all of it in one sitting.Told from the split perspectives of Emma, in the past, and Jane, in the present, this chronicles the similar paths both their lives took once they became the occupant of the infamous 1 Folgate Street. Designed by cutting-edge architect, Edward Monketon, this house is unlike any other. And Monketon requires his tenants to live their life unlike any other, as well.This is the absolute definition of spine-tingling! This managed to make a modern house, full of straight lines and futuristic technology feel like a chilling, Gothic mansion, full of shadowed corners and ghosts of homeowners past. And all without dwelling on any of the melodrama associated with that genre.The no-nonsense style of writing mirrors the architect of the house and becomes just as much a function of the tale as the characters and the setting.I am so eager to uncover the mysteries concerning this unique and compelling thriller and can't wait until I can get the rest of the book in my hands!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.628956"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.628956"]]

I’m just loving these imaginative psychological thrillers coming out recently!!While this appears to be a debut novel, this author apparently has some experience with crime writing, having written this book under a pseudonym. I wish I knew who the ‘crime writer’ is- but I suppose that’s a mystery for another day. In the meantime, I hear this book might be the basis for a movie, and Ron Howard would be the director! So, if that isn’t enough to peak your interest, I don’t know what will. While this is yet ANOTHER book for ‘fans of ‘Gone Girl’ and ‘The Girl on the Train’, and yes, it does have the requisite ‘Girl’ in the title, this book stands on its own merits and needs no other comparison.Two very different women, both having suffered emotional traumas, move in, at different times, into a very affordable, unique, technologically advanced apartment that stresses a minimalist lifestyle. The apartment’s owner screens his tenants by having them fill out a lengthy questionaire, and insists they sign a contract promising to adhere to a strict set of rules… around two hundred of them,(!!!) and if they are not obeyed there will be conseqences. The story alternates between the first person perspectives of Emma and Jane as they describe their time living in Edward Monkford’s apartment building. As the story progresses, we learn the two women bear a striking resemblance to one another, are both attracted to Edward, despite his OCD tendencies, but, Jane discovers that the previous tenant… Emma, died in the apartment, an apparent victim of suicide. Jane becomes somewhat obsessed with Emma and her backstory, while her own personal relationship with Edward begins to deepen. But, her investigation into Emma’s death could come back to haunt her….While it may seem obvious who ‘the girl before’ is, and some may guess correctly, I admit I didn’t see the twist coming and was completely surprised by the way the story developed. The suspense is low key initially, with just a mild creepy feeling permeating the sterile environment the two women live in. But, as the story develops, a feeling of dread begins to grow, and before too long, I found myself immersed in these women’s lives, wanting to send out a warning signal, to advise caution, but didn't know who or what the main threat was. The writing is superb, as the author drew me in, held my attention, managing to evoke feelings of concern for the tenants, on top of creating the feeling of foreboding and dread, that kept me turning those pages. Of the two women, one is more controversial and the other is mildly bland, and were not necessarily people I related to or felt a kinship with, but I did feel sympathy for them and worried on their behalf, despite feeling frustrated with them at times.I was slightly conflicted by the ending, which was somewhat anticlimactic, in my opinion. Other than that, I thought this was a pretty solid thriller, with a unique set up, and kept me interested from beginning to end. 4 stars"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.631157"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.631157"]]

With a list of over 200 conditions that have to be strictly adhered to by whoever lives there and a very thorough interview process for would be tenants it is proving difficult to lease. The story focuses on two troubled women who live at 1 Folgate Street, Emma from the past, and Jane in the present.For the first half of the book I was totally hooked and read the novel at every possible opportunity. It was easy to see why this book was getting so much positive attention and plans to bring to the big screen so far advanced. I was already thinking this book was going to get a high rating off me but then I don't know what exactly changed but my interest suddenly dwindled. I totally understand why other reviewers are raving about it and I am pretty sure I will watch the film when released but unfortunately I didn't find the second half of the novel anywhere as powerful as the opening.I would like to thank Net Galley and Quercus books for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.633510"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.633510"]]

Both women had some sort of superbadawful they were trying to get over when an opportunity to reside at One Folgate Street presented itself.

I mean, first of all, it had the word \"Girl\" in the title, which was a clue that it would be bandwaggoning the tail end of a trend. And then, once I finished reading it, I found Emily May's review that made the connection between this book and Fifty Shades of Grey.Here is a list of all of the things I hated about this book:1. Edward. His character was completely unconvincing. I haven't read FSoG and I have no plans to do so. However, that book has permeated the pop culture to the level that even I was able to draw the parallels between his character and Christian Grey. \"I don't do traditional relationships,\" he purred, smoothly. \"I'm coming over, and I'm going to take you to bed,\" he told her (completely out of the blue, by the way). If a man said that to me, I'd meet him at the door with a sledgehammer and a restraining order. Not that Jane would have a sledgehammer, since it's probably a violation of the preposterous rules that she agreed to before moving into the house to have a sledgehammer. 2. BDSM. Never have I been so unconvinced of spanking in a book. Never.3. BDSM. When Emma called him \"daddy\" it literally came out of nowhere. The ultimate sexual non sequitur. Where in the hell did that come from? 4. Emma. Shut your fucking face you lying liar who lies. Honestly, she was one of the most unlikeable female characters in any book ever. She lied about everything. Everything that made her sympathetic turned out to be entirely false. There were three sociopaths in this book, and she was one of them. Are we supposed to like her? I'm unclear on this point.5. Jane. She is basically the equivalent of that dumb blonde in a horror movie who hides behind the wall of whirling knives instead of running the fuck away while she can. 6. It's treatment of trauma was totally surface and entirely based on the author's idea of what some one who has experienced trauma might do. 7. The house itself was entirely creepy and no one would ever live there. People who are alive, and who are not wax statues, do things that create clutter and mess. Even the tidiest house will have, at a minimum, a family photo displayed. Living in that house would be like living in a mausoleum. No one would voluntarily live in a mausoleum before they had actually become a corpse.8. The twist. I figured it out. Go away.9. The dual narrations in opposing chapters. Tired. Trite. Been done.10. The ending. Nice gimmick.So, yeah, there really wasn't anything I liked about this book. I should've known better, really, than to buy it. But can this trend of unrealistic characters and their behaviors in \"realistic\" fiction be over now, please?

I thought I knew within the first few chapters, but I was wrong--and I'm not telling, sorry.One Folgate Street seems to be the perfect place for those wanting a decent home, yet can't afford one... but it has a strange ability to change it's residents.... The house was designed that way... with a computer system running all the facilities, and interrupting lives at the most inopportune moment, with questionnaires to answer--to see if the tenant(s) are progressing properly. This computer system, called Housekeeper had several beneficial aspects to the home owner...recognizing who was in the shower, and their water preferences, noticing the amount of REM sleep they got, checking their stress levels....and more. Two women are each searching for a place to begin again. Emma, wants security after being violently burgled. Jane has just suffered the stillbirth of a perfect child due to hospital neglect, and needs to move on after quitting her high-paying job, and more importantly, leave the constant reminders that fill her present home of poor little Isabelle. The major problem both face are the terrible price of London flats, and the horrible state of those they can afford.Enter Edward Monkford, a gorgeous, controlling perfectionist with plans* for his architecture to change the lives of those who inhabit his pristine, mausoleum like, architecture. (His idea of architecture and life had changed drastically after the tragic death of his wife and son on the grounds of the building site, but few know of the ancient Japanese ritual that also took place there....) This house is built of only the best materials and is stunningly beautiful in it's minimalism. No wonder it's won awards. The walls are smooth pale stone, all appliances and fixtures hidden from the naked eye...Usually only the rich can afford his places, so why is this place so cheap? Because there's a catch. It begins with a huge questionnaire, with numerous, often seemingly odd questions that must be answered by any prospective tenants. Once finished with that process they are then made aware of a lengthy list of rules that would make life unbearable for most, even if smitten enough with the pristine, beautiful, award winning property to sign the list of rules (including no throw pillows, personal pictures, or books, just to name a few-this house is meant to bring order, peace, and better overall health to the lives of those who live inside). There were other rights to sign over in the lengthy small-typed package, a contract that the exhausted hopeful applicants rarely had the energy left to read closely. The final request was to send three recent pictures upon submittal. There was no secret that most hopefuls are quickly rejected by email--that precious few make it through the lengthy process and acquire an interview--the last hurdle. Not until later does someone take notice of a striking resemblance the accepted tenants bear--not only to each other--but also to Edward's dead wife. All attractive, with the unusual combination of dark hair, porcelain skin, and deep blue eyes.Emma and Jane both have that advantageous resemblance, and can't believe their fortune when chosen to live in this stunning, albeit artfully sparse, masterpiece house for only a pittance. They have no idea of the plans the architect has for them, and that they have become human guinea pigs.One of the best parts of this book for me is it's POV, which is separated by chapters. We have Then: Emma, and Now: Jane. Emma had lived in the house before Jane, but ends up dead. I thought she must be the girl before. In a way she was. When Jane finds out about her, this thriller becomes a chilling mystery. As the POV's are first person, the story of Emma is a bit difficult because she is a very unreliable narrator, causing us to believe her lies, until the story unwinds enough to see who she really is. I loved the way these two stories were interwoven, one picking up quickly where the other had just left off. In no way were these hard to follow, rather the tension mounted as the reader realized there was something strange about their commonality, namely--Edward. I found it ingenious the way they fit together, and especially creepy as on some of the pages there was only a question, either from the computer check-ups, or the original form, that was particularly relevant to the situation going on. These chapter endings served to keep me engrossed in the book, feeling the need to read the next one to find out more.(view spoiler)[Emma moved in with her boyfriend Simon--who passionately loved her--after the burglary that terrified her in her old neighborhood. Most personal items were not allowed in this clean lined house (one of the MANY rules), only a few items of clothing, some toiletries. Simon was not crazy to give up his beloved possessions, but Simon loved Emma far more, so he went along with it, as he always went along with Emma, wanting to make her happy. But soon, Emma is changing, she kicks Simon out, whom she thought she needed desperately weeks before. It's then that Edward enters her life....Yet, Emma had another problem: lies. She's told them to everyone, Simon, the police, the court, and Edward. To get out of the mess some of her lies have caused, she tells more lies--about people, lies that change their lives; and when she ends up dead...no one knows where to turn....the list of suspects is incredibly long, and her case remains unsolved unsolved.When Jane moves in, she is comfortable living in the home's simplicity. It's a new start. One in which Edward also becomes entangled. Soon, she finds out about Emma, and the resemblance (as well as the story of Edward's wife). Her time is spent trying to piece together Emma's death. It's a course that leads her into danger. I loved to watch her amateur crime solving, as she meets many of the people from Emma's past; but there are far too many suspects to get her mind around. Her life becomes endangered when the true murderer gains access to her house (again...not the one I expected), and a terrifying night of hide and seek follows, with fear around every corner; the reader can't help but hold their breath as the pages turn and mysteries are solved. Can Jane overcome the murderer? Or will she end up as Emma had? Another dark haired, blue eyed girl spilling her life-blood on the immaculate stone of this house? Jane actually holds a prize...one in which we find the true meaning of who The Girl Before really is. Can she keep the prize and escape this house, alive?

I went into the book without a lot of expectations. I decided to read this book based on the summary which sounded like it had the making of a good thriller. It turns out that I was hooked by the story almost immediately and found myself doing that thing where I promise that I will read just one more chapter and before I knew it, I had read half the book. This books tells two stories from two different timelines. Emma and Jane have both lived at the house at One Folgate Street. One Folgate Street is not your average house. It is a house with rules. Lots of rules. Rules that most people wouldn't even want to try to follow. If a potential tenant decides that they want to live in the house, the approval process is quite difficult and most are turned away. Emma and Jane were both approved. Emma moved in the house first with her boyfriend, Simon. Later, Jane moves in and learns that Emma died in the house.Both Emma and Jane were going through some very troubling issues when they moved into the house and hoped the move would give them the fresh start they want. Emma and Jane were both very interesting characters. I wouldn't say that I ever really liked them but I really became invested in learning what happened to Emma and wondered what would happen to Jane. The other key character in this book, Edward, was similar in that I didn't really like his characters but I couldn't help myself from wondering what he would do next.The way this book was laid out really worked well. The chapters alternated from Emma and Jane's point of view with Jane spending a lot of energy trying to learn what had happened to Emma. Sometimes the reader would see something happen to Emma just to have it happen to Jane in the next chapter. Instead of feeling redundant, it just added an extra layer to the story. The more that Jane became obsessed with finding out about Emma the more hooked I became. This was a book that was incredibly hard to set aside.My only complaint about the book is that I am not completely sold on the ending. I do like that the book took a lot of twists and turns that I didn't expect. For some reason the ending felt like a bit of a let down for me. I think that I had expected a bigger scene to help wrap everything up. I would highly recommend this book to fans of mystery thrillers. This book grabbed my interest from the first page and never let go. I look forward to reading more from J.P.

The Gone Girl comp is painful for me. That book is my favourite of 2013, and one of my favourite books of all time; I was incredibly excited about this book, not because of that comp, but because of the interesting amp; exciting premise. Unfortunately, the result is more like 50 Shades of Grey meets a pale, brutally-murdered corpse of Gone Girl.50 Shades of Grey? Yep, there's a devilishly handsome, accomplished architect that neither of the two (lame, weak, poorly-developed) women are able to resist; there's BDSM; there's even a frigging contract. I'll tell you this, though, guys: I've had more erotic headaches than this book. Seriously, this book is so replete with awful erotica cliches, I was cringing throughout, from such golden lines as:Yes please, Daddy.Or Edward, the architect, sticking his finger up some woman's vagina in the middle of a massive society party for famous architects (or something), and causing her to go weak at the knees with the daring amp; impossibility of this all.The problem is, there's potential here - real potential. I loved the description of One Folgate Street, and a few of the set pieces, such as when Jane finds Emma's sleeping bag abandoned in a hideaway in the house. I loved the idea, and the continued ideas - especially Edward's interrogation of Jane through his \"questions.\" I thought Jane's final decision was lovely and moving, and pointed towards a wholly different, quieter, but BETTER novel lurking inside the empty, glassy shell of this one: a contemporary novel about one woman's (not two's) impossible choices, longing for a child, and conflict with the control-freak father of that child. However, this book shows, frankly, what a wonderful success Gone Girl is, and why it's been so hard to repeat (except with The Girl on the Train, which had the luxury of at least being an entirely different novel behind the \"Girl\" veneer). The characters here are not well-developed; what was so wonderful about Gone Girl was its utterly unique ability to keep the twists within the focus of what we already knew about the characters. When Gone Girl twisted, it felt like whole new possibilities jumped up within the range of what we had already been teased amp; knew. In The Girl Before, on the other hand, characters are kept ambiguous and dully unlikeable in order for anything to be possible. Worse than that, though, when The Girl Before runs out of places to go, it lurches haphazardly into cliche and a straight-up Gone Girl ripoff, unfortunately borrowing the worse aspect of it: (view spoiler)[Flynn's penchant for false rape accusations, a pattern which is almost exactly duplicated here, with Emma falsely accusing not just one man but THREE SUCCESSIVE MEN of raping her (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.663384"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.663384"]]

Not something I could ever do, by the way. I love my possessions, especially my books. And no pets? Never. But anyway….The story is told in alternating chapters between past and present. Both women who chose the house have suffered loss or harm - a break-in while she was home by one and the loss of an unborn child by the other. So, they have their reasons for choosing something so different. In between the chapters, there are questions from the questionnaire the landlord gives prospective tenants, just so you can see how strange it all really is. This book was a mixed message for me. Some ideas were interesting, like the Japanese cultural ideas that Edward espouses. Or Jane’s comparing of her relationship with Edward to palimpsest or pentimento. But other things just really freaked me out. Like ikizukuri, which is just barbaric. I know, I'm freaked out at the idea of eating live seafood when this is a book about murder. But that sort of thing really sets the tone. There's also a dominance and sex theme. Not talking 50 Shades here, but the man having all the control and calling all the shots. Just not my cup of tea. I had no fondness for any of the main characters either. There's a decent twist towards the end of the book that keeps it interesting and then the ending is positively wild and engrossing. I'm really torn how to rate this. The first ¾ of the book was two stars, but the last ¼ was close to a four for excitement. Guess I'm going with a three. And what is it with the use of “girl” in titles, for pete’s sake? Emma is a woman. My thanks to netgalley and Ballantine Books for an advance copy of this book.

Perhaps he needs a fancy stay at a \"resort\" with soft walls because he's Looney tunes, orrrr maybe he just needs a stiff drink and a good psychiatrist. Either way, he's on the short list of possible suspects when one of the tenants dies in the house that's creepy enough to make you consider staying at the Bates Motel instead. Cue the scary piano/violin combo.The book is written with alternating chapters from the pov of the dead woman as well as the new tenant who is on a quest to find out the truth about what really happened in that house.So, needless to say... It's 2:25 am, and I'm scared to go to sleep. Because I finished this book. I had a whole bunch of mental notes I'd thought of, so I could point out all the unique and down right intriguing aspects of this story,but...that flew out the window, along with my sense of adult logic that tells me not to be afraid of the dark, or of the boogeyman that may or may not be lurking somewhere in the shadows. It's not my fault, it was this nailbiting story that frightened me because I couldn't figure it out. Usually authors give away teensy morsels that tantalize readers and allow them to have a strong suspicion about who's doin' what to whom, and who the psycho is. But oh no, not this time. J.P. Delaney is a talented lil sneak who knows how to make you feel like a 5 year-old hidden under the covers like a scaredy cat. If you enjoy adrenaline-inducing stories, you will love this one. It's complicated, has more twists and turns than a winding road, and the characters are a psychoanalyst's wet dream. Delaney must've done years of research to perfect the complexities of these characters. I'm not just saying that, either. If you choose to read this, you'll know exactly what I mean, because the knowledge in this book regarding a multitide of topics is nothing short of impressive.Normally I don't compare books, but it's safe to say that if you love books like The Girl On The Train, Before I Go To Sleep, Disclaimer or Gone Girl, then you will love this one too.Thanks to Netgalley for letting me read this in exchange for an honest review.

A novel that gained the eyes of editors around the world at the Frankfurt Book Fair and a bidding war started based on 53 pages. A soon to be made movie by Ron Howard. The story of a house and the women who lived in it. The past Emma and the present Jane. The narrative splitting between both characters; in many cases the story repeats itself and you see it from two different point of views. The owner of the house; the minimalist architect Edward and his over 200 stipulations to live in this house. A house that electronically control the environment, the light, the sounds, a house where you can't bring your life in to. I wasn't a fan of Emma she felt too weak and had no power whatsoever over the men in her life, I wanted to scream and shout and tell her to be stronger and not a weak person. Jane develops and evolves with the story and she grows on you. You feel her happiness and pain. Edward on the other hand is cold as ice... a perfectionist control freak, that I wouldn't know why any woman would want to be with him. Why should a woman be fine in living in a house that would cut off her water if she didn't put the dishes back or if she didn't clean the shampoo stain or some other reason... it makes no logical sense and it's 2017. It was a book that flowed nice even if it didn't make sense in some points, and in other parts the author did give early clues for future events that made them less enjoyable. It was a good book and I can see why people would buy it when it comes out."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.684525"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.684525"]]

I love reading reviews from my fellow book bloggers because I trust their opinions and know they won’t spoil anything for me, but on Goodreads/Amazon you just never know. All that being said, I had heard that The Girl Before was getting mixed reactions so I checked things out for myself and it seems people either love this book or they hate it. I happened to love it, but just know that it seems like it’s not for everyone. You have dual perspectives here, Emma is Then, Jane is Now. This style never fails to reel me in and by ten percent I was totally hooked. Emma and her boyfriend Simon move into One Folgate Street together, then two years later Jane moves in alone to start fresh after a tragedy. As the chapters flip back and forth, the similarities between the two women are frighteningly uncanny. One of the biggest complaints that I’ve seen about this book is that no one finds the premise believable. One Folgate Street is owned by an architect named Edward who is a rigid perfectionist to put it mildly. He’s created a sterile, modern home with new technology that’s amazing but also creepy. No house keys are needed, the shower remembers what temperature you prefer, etc. The application prospective tenants must fill out in order to be considered has two hundred questions. That’s right, TWO hundred and they are anything but typical. They require the applicant to answer moral dilemmas and they’re just very odd. He also requires a picture which is just bizarre. Would I ever want to live in a place with a tyrannical control freak as a landlord? No thank you. But as a premise for a book I thought it was fabulous and it didn’t bother me that it wasn’t exactly believable.Beyond what I’ve already discussed I won’t say more about the plot. This was a highly addictive and provocative read for me, a real page turner about the quest for perfection and the obsession that goes hand in hand with it. I was blindsided by one of the major twists and the smaller ones threw me for a loop as well. I can’t wait to see this play out on the big screen as Ron Howard is directing, I think it’ll be fantastic! Again, this seems to be a really polarizing read, you’ll either love it or hate it. If you’ve read it I would love to see which side of the fence you fall on!

After his wife and child died there in a tragic accident, (or was it?) Edward decides to rent the home, but only to those who pass his strict and lengthy interview process.

Jane, who recently lost a child and feels the stark blank walls are just what she needs to help recover, and Emma, the notorious 'Girl Before'.There are moments of great intensity here, but also there were some chapters that fell flat, which is part of why this didn't cut it as a 5 star for me. The other reason is that I really didn't like any of the characters, which made it hard for me to feel any kind of sympathy for their plights. I was hoping for a better ending, although to be honest I can't say just how, so it probably is the best ending possible.

Delaney"], ["date", "Nov 30, 2016"], ["review_text", "I received a copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest review.The Girl Before started out great. It's an addicting psychological thriller about two unrelated women who both, at different times, agree to move into an experimental house designed by minimalist architect Edward Monkford. The house comes with a long set of rules: no clutter, no children, no pets. Nothing but the absolutely essential. Chapters alternate between their perspectives following two different timelines; we have Then: Emma and Now: Jane. Though the young women don't know each other, their narratives parallel and we see Jane falling into the same patterns and making the same choices as Emma did, lending the story a tense air of inevitability - it's like watching two trains about to collide, and it's terrifying.This started out being one of the creepiest thrillers I've read in a long time. I raced through the pages in order to get to the bottom of the mystery. And then it all went downhill.I try my best to write my reviews without spoilers, but all of my problems with this book come down to the twists and reveals, so without further ado:(view spoiler)[1. Emma lying about being raped. On the one hand, I love unreliable narrators, especially in this genre. The fact of Emma being a pathological liar is fascinating, and it's fun trying to wade through her web of deceit to discern the truth. But then we arrive here, and... well. What a letdown. I'm not saying that false rape accusations don't happen. But in a society where allegations of rape are often met with scorn and skepticism, where alleged rapists are let out of prison after six months because of promising athletic careers or even appointed president of the United States, do we really need more fictional accounts of women lying about being raped? Especially seeing as the biggest name in this genre from recent years also focuses on a false rape accusation, it stings even more seeing it repeated here. Once was enough. (I won't name the title because of spoilers, but I think we all know what I'm talking about.)2. The reveal that Simon was the killer. This is one of the rare cases where I think I would have preferred the killer to be the person we all guessed it was on page one, rather than this outlandish twist. In Edward Monkford we have a fascinating and terrifying depiction of a narcissist and a sociopath, someone who seems from the outset perfectly capable of murder. While it seemed a bit too obvious that he was the killer, I couldn't help but to expect it. I wanted to see what drove him to that point, what was enough to make him snap. Even though I thought I had this book figured out, I didn't care. It was still addicting and tense and my heart raced as I tore through the pages, waiting for the final pieces of Edward murdering Emma to click into place. But no, it turns out that Edward's just a bit of an eccentric weirdo, and boring and possessive Simon is secretly crazy enough to murder the woman he loves. Simon was a jerk, there's no doubt about that, but I still didn't really buy this. Something that writers of the thriller genre fail to grasp is that sometimes less is more. Sometimes a bit of predictability is okay if your characters and situations are unique enough, which was certainly the case here. Readers are just as likely to enjoy a book because of its vivid characters - and Edward is certainly that - as unexpected plot twists. Twists like this need to strike a balance between shocking and believable in order to be effective, and this one relied too heavily on the former. 3. Down Syndrome being equated with imperfection and Jane being forced to choose between the epitome of perfection in the house and her 'imperfect' baby... really????? Could we not have told this story without going here??? [note: edited on 12/12/16. I originally incorrectly stated that the baby had autism, while it actually is Down Syndrome, as someone reminded me in the comments. I apologize for the error - I hadn't had the book with me at the time I wrote this review and was going off memory.] (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.709308"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.709308"]]

Unfortunately although I really did enjoy The Girl Before it didn’t turn out to be the “thrilling” read I was expecting. The story is told by two narrators Jane who moves into the perfect house, or is it? There are so many rules and regulations (200 in fact!) some of which are bizarre to say the least, and then other chapters are told from Emma’s POV whose mysterious death, becomes central to the plot. As the past and present become entwined you really can’t help wondering where the plot is heading. One Folgate Street is not a place I would choose to live in that’s for sure, with an obsessive and controlling landlord you just know things aren’t going to end well.The characters in The Girl Before aren’t the most likeable characters I’ve come across they are manipulative, selfish and self absorbed, but I must admit I was eager to learn more about them, and to see how the connection between characters would pan it. There are so many lies and half truths surrounding the two protagonists I found it difficult to know what to believe, but it certainly made me dislike them even more when the author reveals them. As Jane realises her life is running parallel to the tragic Emma’s events take a dark and sinister turn. Interestingly One Folgate Street takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story, which sounds strange but it actually adds a sense of malice and claustrophobia to its tale.Although I read this book in a day, and the plot is highly original personally I found the ease that the two women fall for their landlord less than credible, some scenes read more like 50 shades than a psychological thriller! When I picked up The Girl Before the first couple of chapters hint at the malice and darkness that surround the house, so I was expecting at least a few OMG moments, but unfortunately they never materialised. Don’t get me wrong it was an easy book to pick it up and read in one sitting as It did have elements that I enjoyed I’m sure The Girl Before will be loved by many, but even after the big reveal I was left feeling slightly disappointed as I expected so much more."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.716958"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.716958"]]

Emma, who lives there first, ends up dying under mysterious circumstances. The case can't conclusively decide whether her death was an accident, a suicide, or murder. Jane moves in a little more than a year later, after the apartment had been vacant for a year. As she gets settled in, she learns about Emma, and starts doing a little digging into her death. She quickly comes to find that Emma looks a lot like her, and that they both had relationships with the same man - the architect of the house. One Folgate Street is an architectural masterpiece. It's entirely integrated with technology, and is a beautiful home. That said, in order to live there, there are 200 rules that the tenant has to abide by. Yes, you read that right. 200! Including no books, pictures, or personal items. In addition to agreeing to the rules, in order to live in the apartment, tenants have to fill out a long survey, send in pictures, and complete an in person interview before getting approved. Why anyone would agree to all of that is beyond me. Give up my books?! No, thank you.The Girl Before is positioned as a thriller, though personally, I found it really slow moving. I didn't dislike the build up, but the story didn't feel like a thriller at all (and barely even felt like a mystery) until more than 70% into the book. Details and revelations come very very slowly, and leave the reader little room to guess what happened and what the end of the book would entail. What I did enjoy reading about were the details of the house. While I could never in a million years live in a house with that many rules, the technology the house employed was amazing. Windows that automatically darkened depending on the time of day? Shower heads that were responsive by person and knew the exact water temperature you liked? Yes, please! I also enjoyed that the story alternated between Emma and Jane, so we were able to understand both women and what happened to them as it was happening. That said, their voices sounded identical. It was really difficult to tell them apart, and I found myself flipping back and forth to chapter titles so I could remember whose part I was reading a few times. All in all, I did like the book. I loved the twists and turns that happened in the last 30% of the book. I felt like that's when it really turned into a thriller! The resolution was great, and I really loved the ending and final revelations! If you're looking for a book that's instant action from page one, this isn't the book for you. If you're comfortable with something slow building but interesting and willing to wait a while for the action, definitely pick this one up! I would rate this 3.5 stars if half stars were a thing on Goodreads. Because I loved the last 20%, I'll round up for Goodreads purposes.The Girl Before will be released on January 24, 2017. Thank you to NetGalley, J.P. Delaney, and Random House Bellantine for this eARC in exchange for an honest review.

I started reading and was hooked, so I went ahead and bought it.Five gritty, difficult stars for this whirlwind. I feel so used. I loved the first third of the book, hated the second, and decided that it was all horribly necessary at the end.I debated with four stars because I thought everyone in this book was gross. Even Jane. Not at first, at first I thought she was smart and mature and a really relatable, regular woman. But then she started making appointments with people to find out information and then challenging them when they told her what they knew. Like what? Why are you seeking people out just to argue with them?But as it turns out, all of it was necessary. Edward's ridiculous personality, the house rules that most (all?) independent women would find abominable, the terrible, sad situations that caused these women to allow themselves to be governed, the super graphic sex scenes that take the non-erotica-reading audience by surprise, the selfishness of every. single. person in this book. It is all so staunchly apparent 2/3 of the way through that I found myself really questioning the author's integrity. Why would Delaney hook me like that, get me to pay for the book, and then make me hang out with stupid, annoying, crazy people for the remainder?Well, because (s)he is a genius. As all my initial opinions started falling apart, I started tearing through the book harder. Not so much to find out the ending, but to find out if I'd really been duped. And I thought I had until the very last few pages.What a hell of an ending. After I finished it, I sat around thinking for a long time. I really wanted to give it four stars because I'm still disgusted by everything. But you see, that was the point.Not only that, I was dragged through all these undesirable emotions voluntarily. Someone was controlling my actions, my thoughts, my opinions the whole time, making me think I needed to keep going. But I kept on with it. I kept putting myself through it.

It's already being adapted into a movie, there is a lot of hype, and most people seemed to love it. I wasn't a fan of the frequently changing perspective. The premise of the book - although seriously far-fetched - was unique and the plot really was intriguing. My main issue, I couldn't get excited about any of the characters. They all just left me feeling....pretty much nothing. The one scene that triggered some emotion was the one involving food (if you've read this, you'll probably know what I mean).

There are obviously several twists and turns, and I enjoyed the latter half of the book more while other reviewers actually seemed to prefer the first half.

Most enigmatic is the architect – possibly of more things than just buildings, so the scene is set for a tense and fascinating story.So we get told both stories in alternate timelines – Emma, the girl before of the title and Jane, the current occupant of a house that will divide opinion on whether or not you would like to live in it. Both Emma and Jane definitely do but there are all sorts of hoops to jump through and for Emma it is not going to go so well….This is a clever, twisty and intelligent thriller that leads you down one path then another, exposes each character slowly but surely until you see who they actually are, it is a tense and fascinating build up to a finale that exposes the true colours of everyone involved. In the background, stark and watchful is this place they occupy, a modern and utterly engaging home that sounds both heavenly and irritating in equal measure.Great writing here – really really immersive, descriptively gorgeous, utterly creepy in some parts and an honest to God page turner.

There is an extensive application asking strange questions and then a private interview with the architect if the applicant makes it that far. There is a thick contract listing hundreds of rules that must be followed in order to live there. Who would want to live like that? The house is minimalist to the extreme although every item is top of the line. There is technology up the ying yang and a housekeeper and a gardener. Everything must be perfect. The computer system keeps track of you and even controls the shower temperature and your body's functions like blood pressure. There will be times when questionnaires must be completed. Until they are completed the house shuts down- no water, heat etc.  It didn't appeal to me at all but there are plenty of interested people.

Moving in even after finding a long list of rules to follow to rent the home Jane still believes this is the fresh start she needs. However, Jane finds herself becoming fascinated with finding out what happened to One Folgate Street's former resident Emma. Finding that Emma died within the walls of her new home Jane can't help but investigate to find out the truth for herself before she follows along in Emma's footsteps. The Girl Before is told from alternating points of view between Jane, the current tenant, in the present and Emma, the former tenant in the past. There are often times that there is no clear distinction with dialogue by use of quotations but this really didn't bother this reader at all. I found the story to be immediately gripping and intense as I learned what brought these two women into this home. Both characters in this story are coming from rough times in their lives and needing a new start. When shown the home at One Folgate Street they are told there is a long list of rules to live in the home anywhere from no books to no curtains or changes made to the home. Thinking that a new start is more important than possessions the contract is quickly signed by both and that is where the intensity begins. Now while I didn't quite find this a perfect read in my opinion as there were some things happening that I didn't quite agree with being added into the story I still found myself quite compelled with this one to give it four stars in the end. I'd certainly recommend checking this one out to the thriller fans.

To be granted lease, you must fill in a laborious questionnaire and attend a face-to-face meeting with Edward himself, and even then, you’re unlikely to be approved. There are a large number of rules you have to abide by when you live in the house, such as, no books (?!?!?!), no rugs, no curtains, and no leaving things out, such as clothes, toiletries etc, to name a few. You must also open your home for tours every so often and complete various questionnaires/assessments throughout your stay.So, I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking “who the hell would agree to that?” but as it happens, two women choose to live at One Folgate Street. Thanks to its low rent and dishy architect, both Jane and Emma are happy putting up with all the rules. Jane is the girl from now, and Emma is the girl before. Both women are troubled and both begin a relationship with architect Edward.What follows is a novel full of mystery and sex. If you’re also not into the whole “daddy” thing then this won’t be for you.Starting off this book, I was very worried I was going to hate it, because I’d seen a lot of people say the focus on kinky sex as a bit left field and overpowering to the plot. But, I managed to get over that when it started to appear in the story. In my opinion, it wasn’t as bad as many people had made it out to be and in any case, you can always skip over it. I thought it was going to go full 50 Shades at some moments, but it managed to avoid any of the scenes becoming too tactless.The mystery of “the girl before” is certainly intriguing and kept me hooked (for the first half, at least). I liked the way this was set out as Emma (before) and Jane (now) and how the chapters often mirrored each other so we could see the similarities in each of the tenants lives and relationships with Edward.What I didn’t like about this book was the characters, which I’m kind of assuming was the goal by Delaney? If not, then he/she (does anyone know and can inform me on their gender?) is pretty terrible at creating characters. Although Edward is set up to be our “villain”, I found Emma to be the most dislikable character, even after all was said and done. She was manipulative, unnecessarily forward, obnoxious and total putty in Edward’s hands. Women who can’t act on their own accord because of a man infuriate me, which is probably why I didn’t get on with this novel that well, as it’s kind of what the whole plot is about. I like my women strong and independent! The ending of this novel, no word of a lie, infuriated me. What a total cop out. People are comparing this to Gone Girl, LOL. The conclusion to this novel is the most overused and uninspired “twist” you can ever imagine. What a way to ruin a perfectly OK novel.Thanks to Netgalley and Quercus Books for giving me the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.796905"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.796905"]]

He is a minimalist and is very choosy about who he will lease the house too.

Emma wants to find a safe place to live after being burglarized and attacked in her home. She is approved to live at the house and moves in with her boyfriend Simon. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is looking to find some kind of solace in the stark walls of the house. Both Jane and Emma bear a striking resemblance to each other and to Edwards late wife.

Was it really just an accident or were there other mitigating factors resulting in Emma’s death?There were some aspects of this book that I did not like but it was still an interesting concept .

I’d like to give it a 3 for some good writing but the story was just so utterly unbelievable and the characters so unlikable that I don’t want anyone to think that I would recommend this book. The author is obviously very talented so I’ll stick with the 3.The premise of the book sounded interesting, and it certainly had some rave reviews from other authors: “Dazzling, startling, and above all cunning—a pitch-perfect novel of psychological suspense.“—Lee ChildFor a thriller to be a real page turner and give me that “tingly, tense” feeling, I need to find it believable. The two main characters, Emma and then Jane are our narrators and the chapters alternate between the two voices. Emma has suffered a personal trauma and supposedly is the perfect type of woman who would be taken in by Edward and his incredibly constricting rules for renting a home that he built with many things computer controlled by someone called “housekeeper”. She has to fill out an application that is about 20 pages long and asks incredibly personal and downright stupid questions. Emma moves in, a victim of Edward’s sociopathic, narcissistic personality and has a relationship with him. Jane is our present day narrator, another woman who suffered a personal tragedy, Same rules, same manipulation, same relationship with the multi-flawed Edward. When she starts to investigate what happened to Emma, Edward becomes furious and cuts off his relationship with Jane. She,however, continues to investigate Emma’s death including befriending her previous boyfriend, Simon. Here enters another component to the puzzle of what really happened to Emma.I could not believe that anyone would want to rent a place that has so many manipulative rules and does not allow you not to bring in anything personal to change the appearance of the stark, minimalist environment. Why would you rent from someone who is so domineering and obviously manipulative?What really put me over the line on this book however was the (*spoiler alert) introduction of the subject of Down’s syndrome. I’m not sure why the author chose to bring up this very sensitive subject in the telling of a psychological thriller. I felt it was out of place and served no purpose. There was also way too much sexual detail in this book, more than I felt was necessary to tell the story. The Girl Before we find out is not really Emma, but I'll leave that to the readers to find out.I would not recommend this book but I’m sure there is an audience out there for it. I did finish it as I wanted to read the outcome but that also was disappointing to me.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher and NetGalley."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.821395"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.821395"]]

I remember reading a sample of this book, and being blown away by its fantastic opening, thinking I can’t wait to continue reading this book! After days of wondering what happened to Emma, how did she die, did the technology in the house kill her or was it the architect himself, does the same fate await Jane? – So many questions! As soon as the full book was made available to me, I dropped everything to finish it.It’s not easy to become a resident of One Folgate Street; first there’s a long list of rules to abide by, second there’s a lengthy application form – not many make it that far, but if you do, you have to past the interview stage of the application process. However, once you’re a tenant, you get to reside in an ultra-minimalist house run by tomorrow’s technology, designed by a world leading architect.Two narratives run side by side in this book – Then amp; Now. Then was Emma, the former tenant, who died under mysterious circumstances, while living there. Now – Jane, the current tenant. From the offset, we know that the two narratives were going to become entwined and I loved the clever way they did.Aimed at fans of Gone Girl, this book does have the unlikeable characters, yes, but other than that I believe this book should stand alone as when I was reading this book, I had no thoughts of any other book, I was so wrapped up in this story. You do start off liking both Emma and Jane, but as the story progresses, Delaney shows us the true characteristics of both these women, and let me tell you, I was not prepared for their deceitful, vindictive nature; at times, some of their actions literally made me cringe. As events unfolded, I was shocked and pulled deeper into the story as I had no idea what was to come; the alternating chapters between Emma and Jane made this book so addictive, each narrative left me wanting more, this book kept me turning pages at great speed.I don’t even know why I bother to guess how books end anymore, or who the guilty party is, as again, here, I made my prediction, and I was so far off the mark, I’m not even going to say anymore. Overall, this book is fast-paced, thrilling and thoroughly addictive, I highly recommend it and I’m sure you’ll fly through its suspenseful pages just as I did.*Thank you to the author (JP Delaney) and the publisher (Quercus) for granting me access to a digital copy of this book via Netgalley*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.824309"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.824309"]]

O leitor fica sempre em dúvida se ele é o herói, a vítima ou o vilão desta história e embora seja uma destas coisas, não consegui gostar desta personagem, com as suas obsessões um pouco bizarras.Quanto às duas protagonistas, gostei de ambas embora tenha gostado um pouco mais da Jane porque teve um pouco mais de coragem do que a Emma mas são duas personagens muito semelhantes, às vezes com as mesmas dúvidas e pensamentos, portanto se não tivesse atenção ao início do capítulo que indicava que ponto de vista se tratava, acabava por confundir ambas.Eu não li ainda muitos thrillers psicológicos mas tenho vindo a gostar de alguns muito bem falados no mercado mas este infelizmente não me convenceu. Li o livro em dois dias pelo tempo disponível e fácil leitura mas tirando o mistério à volt do Edward e do assassino, o livro não puxou muito pela minha cabeça, achei tudo muito mediano.Ainda assim para os amantes do género acho que é um livro que merecesse sem duvida uma leitura, não esperem muito e já agora se conseguirem não leiam a sinopse pois revela um spoiler do livro. http://algodaodoceparaocerebro.blogsp..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.844428"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.844428"]]

It's important to be able to form an independent opinion of a book despite hearing and reading the reviews of others. This is especially difficult when a book has been receiving sterling reviews, as this one has. But in this case, I need to go against the grain and say that this read just didn't do it for me.Despite this book getting off to a promising start, I found that it very soon became unrealistic and lacked substance. I found myself constantly asking \"why would anyone do that?\" or saying to myself \"that would never happen in real life.\" Without giving anything away, let me just say that I don't know of a single person that would agree to rent and live in a house in which they were not even allowed to put a coffee mug down, or to leave the book they are busy reading in the lounge. A house that required the lessee to sign a lease with more than 200 prohibitive conditions, where the lessee had to agree to random surveys about themselves and if not completed within a short time period, certain fundamental appliances in the house would not work, like the shower or the stove. That is all just too ridiculously far fetched for me. I also found Edward to be an unrealistic character and one that would not get very far in real life, let alone be absolutely adored by not one but two woman. I know we are talking about a fictional story here, but still, for me a story must always be believable or else you lose me. So, unfortunately I must conclude by saying that this one won't make it onto my favourites list for this year.

I don't actually have a do not recommend pile but I may have to make one for books such as this.This book follows the stories of two women (eerily similar women but more about that in a moment) who have the opportunity to move into One Folgate Street- a techno-minimalist state-of-the-art architectural masterpiece- at a discounted rent as long as they can abide by a strict set of rules. The chapters alternate between Emma (then) and Jane (now) who discovers that Emma mysteriously died in the apartment and is determined to find out what really happened to her. The story heavily centers around romance, but a twisted and unenjoyable one. After each woman moves in, they are immediately approached by Edward, the owner/architect, who tells them bluntly \"I want to go to bed with you.\" Both women have the same response which is \"Oh, how intriguing. Well, alright then.\" Not... how creepy I don't know you? No thoughts about the potential complications that could arise from sleeping with the notoriously neurotic owner of the building? Not to mention that as the women actually get to know Edward he clearly has some major control issues and so I just couldn't understand their attraction towards him. I'm already rolling my eyes, but then the relationship spirals into a dominating, controlling, obsessive mess that became seriously cringeworthy.I considered DNFing at this point- and I never DNF- but told myself maybe it would be twisty and turny enough to redeem itself and I pressed onward.

Having been a victim of an armed robbery she no longer feels safe in the flat she shares with her boyfriend Simon. Convinced a new house would help with her new start Emma amp; Simon go house hunting but nothing in their price range seems right or, more importantly, safe enough. That is until they visit One Colgate street, a beautiful minimalist house designed by the mysterious (and handsome) Edward Monkton. The only problem iis that to live there you have to agree tiotio follow 200 very strict and bizarre rules, fill in a lengthy questionnaire anbd be interviewed by the architect himself. Despite all this, and her boyfriend's reservations, Emma iis determined to live there. She is therefore thrilled when their application gets approved as she is sure the house will help make her a better person and help aid her recovery from the roibbery. Now: Jane us another lady who really wants to leave her past behind her with a move to a new house. Having recently suffered a still birth Jane can't bear to stay in the house she expected to brinbg her baby daughter home to. Like Emma, she immediately falls in love with One Folgate Street and is convinced that iit will be the new start she needs. Whilst meeting with the architect she finds herself a little attracted to him, so when flowers start arriving she flatters herself thinking they are from him. However a chance meeting with the man leaving the flowers leads to her discovering they are meant for Emma, the lady that used to live there and sadly died in the house. The man leaves before Jane can discover moire leaving her confused and a little uneasy. I've unfortunately had to stop reading this book as I was finding Jane's story quite upsetting. I lost my son, Christopher, at 24 weeks and Jane's experiences were too like my own and bought back a load of really bad memories. I don't know if the author has experienced something similar but it his description bought a lump to my throat, particularly the attitude of the hospital to it all. There were parts of the book I was enjoying up to that part. The dual story line was interesting and the lives of Emma and Jane echoing each other helped to build the tension and made for a interesting read. I wasn't too sure where the story was going as it seemed to deviate off into fifty shades of gray territory at times which was a little confusing. Despite her story being a hard read I liked Jane as a character and found her to be quite sensible. I also understood her more as I knew exactly how she was feeling. I wasn't so sure I liked Emma as she seemed a little silly and out of control and I found her a little annoying to be honest. This book has had a lot of great reviews and hype on social media and I would encourage anyone to read it for themselves and make up their own minds. If you have suffered the loss of a child I would say you should avoid this book as it does make for painful reading. Thank you to Quercus publishers for giving me a copy of this boom to review. I'm glad I tried it as I would have always wondered about it but it was just ok hard for me to finish. I wish there had been a warning regarding the child loss story as I wouldn't have read it."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.878564"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.878564"]]

The Girl Before, really is a book that grips you, it is compelling, breath-taking and has more twists than twister. This is a book that really will tick all the boxes for fans of the psychological thriller, there is the mystery, the intrigue, the changes of pace and twists that you cannot predict to where and when, and like a magician JP Delaney is not afraid to use the sleight of hand.This is thriller is two stories that become one around One Folgate Street, a perfect house for some, with a set of rules for all tenants that are constantly assessed by the technology around the house. The house is designed to be perfect, to some austere to others an architectural dream and to all residents an experiment in a new way of life, for the better.Edward Monkford designed One Folgate Street after the death of his wife and child and it is in a way a monument to them as well as pushing the boundaries of design. The house is not for everyone is it is very minimalistic mixed with cutting edge technology, its own housekeeping system that manages everything within the house, including the tenant. Before a tenant can move in they have to sign a legal document to show that they will not break any of the 200 rules that are in place to manage the house.The story is split in two, between Emma (Then), and Jane (Now) and how they both lived within One Folgate Street and its rules. We also discover the tragic reasons that both are happy to do away with many of their personal possessions to live a new austere life, which Edward Monkford observes and manages for them.Emma and Jane are two totally different people and we see their stories unfold separately but at the same time see how Monkford influences both their lives. Both have been through traumatic events in the life and are looking for change, the stories are told in both the past and present tense which helps to draw you in. At the same time, all the chapters are separated by various psychoanalytic questions the sort that are taken during a psychometric test so there is no right or wrong answer.Throughout the book, we see that both Emma and Jane have obsessions that seem to take over everything that they are doing. Jane’s obsession is Emma and how she lived and died within the house and whether there was any foul play in her death. Jane’s obsession of Emma is destructive in part especially when she feels like the house is spying on her.This book is punchy and will easily become a bestseller and it is understandable why this has already been optioned for film production.

This book is on lists everywhere as one of this years \"it\" books for thrillers. I enjoyed the book, but I also had some problems with it. My husband is an architect so I could relate to much of the details in the story that were architectural and I appreciated that research went into those parts of the story to make it more authentic to the character. I liked the way that the story was told in alternating chapters between our two main female narrators. I thought it was very interesting and creative how the author would tell the stories that were parallel and different at the same time, without confusing the reader. The story itself was interesting and there were little easter eggs throughout the story that helped you figure out who the killer was. However you didn't really arrive at that until about 15% left in the book, although you may have suspicions you are never really quite sure who \"done it.\" I also liked that there were multiple references to Breakfast At Tiffany's through the book, as that is one of my favorite movies. I found the story to be engaging and interesting. I did get to points where I did not want to put it down.There were only a few things that were off putting. The biggest was the author's overused phrase \"he/she goes\" when explaining about another characters talking to the narrator. Now, I read an unfinished copy so that could very well be edited out by the time this hits shelves. Another thing that bothered me is that when you get to about 50% the book suffers from a lot of repetitiveness. It seems that we keep hearing the same thing over and over for some time before the story finally starts moving forward again. That slowed the book down considerably for me. To me it didn't seem that there was a purpose for the story to keep repeating the same information continuously. However, once it started moving again, the story gripped you until the very end. Overall I did enjoy the story and would read more by this author.

Read it in two days.I won this book from the Goodreads giveaway program - an advance reader's edition - and am quite glad I did. I didn't know what to expect, but this was one great read.Told from the POV of two alternating MC's, both young women, in present tense. However, one woman, Emma, is labeled as 'Then,' and the other, Jane, is labeled 'Now.' This makes the story unfold in a rather linear fashion, even though Emma's story is happening prior to Jane's.Confused? Not if you're reading the book. Both women, at different times, elect to live in a highly technologically 'advanced' house designed by an enigmatic and exacting architect. There are a hundred 'rules' to follow in order to live in the house, including no rugs, no books, no pets, and so on, but the house is almost a living thing, digitally wired/enhanced in such a way as to eliminate most 'clutter' and complexity from life. It's clean living elevated to the nth degree, without doors, with all clean lines, smooth surfaces, and just the barest necessities provided. It's warm and clean and safe, and if you hate clutter, you'd love this house.(Myself, I like a little clutter.)Anyhow, both young women are coming from a difficult place - a burglary and possible sexual assault for one, a terrible miscarriage for the other. The opportunity to 'start fresh' and live in such an architectural wonder is appealing to both, but with different outcomes. The way their lives intersect, and what happens when one, then the other get involved with the architect who designed the house, leads to a murder mystery, and revelations that are equally surprising.It was an intriguing read and I've heard that a movie may be in the offing, directed by Ron Howard. Regardless if true or not, I highly recommend this to suspense/thriller/mystery readers.Five stars.

Das Cover und der Titel haben sofort meine Aufmerksamkeit erregt, obwohl ich langsam etwas durcheinander komme mit all den Bücher, die irgendwas mit 'Girl' im Titel tragen. Andererseits ist der Buchtitel durchaus passend für die Geschichte.In der Geschichte begleiten wir Jane, die uns durch die gegenwärtige Zeit führt und Emma, die wir in Rückblicken kennen lernen. Jane hat einen schweren Schicksalsschlag hinter sich und hat nun die Chance auf einen Neuanfang in einem technisch hochmodernen Haus. Das Haus ist sehr speziell und stellt gewissermaßen Ansprüche an seine Bewohner - es verfügt kaum über Möbel, strahlt allgemein keine Gemütlichkeit aus und alles funktioniert digital. Als Jane erfährt, dass ihre Vormieterin, Emma, im Haus gestorben ist, fängt sie an zu recherchieren und deckt so ungeahnte Dinge auf.Durch den Wechsel der Perspektiven lernen wir beide Figuren sehr gut kennen. Allerdings sind sich die beiden nicht unähnlich, es dreht sich oft um ähnliche Begebenheiten, so dass ich manchmal mitten im Kapitel zurückblättern musste, weil unklar war, aus welcher Perspektive ich gerade lese. Beide Frauen haben recht naiv und gutgläubig gehandelt, was mich manchmal schon etwas aufgeregt hat. Wie oft kann man bitte das Schrillen sämtlicher Alarmglocken überhören? Und warum kamen den Damen teilweise erst Monde später Gedanken, die quasi auf der Hand lagen? Nichtsdestotrotz haben mir beide Perspektiven insofern gefallen, dass ich das Buch kaum weglegen konnte. Der sogenannte 'charismatische' Besitzer und Architekt des Hauses war mir jedoch die unerträglichste Person des Buches. Edward wies so viele Parallelen zu typischen männlichen Hauptfiguren in New Adult Romanen auf, dass ich nicht umhin kam, ihn als eine Art 'Psycho-Mr.Grey' zu sehen.Trotz der gewöhnungsbedürftigen Figuren, habe ich die Geschichte in kurzer Zeit durchgelesen. Anfangs war mein Lesefluss etwas gestört von der Tatsache, dass in den Rückblenden die wörtliche Rede nicht gekennzeichnet war, daran habe ich mich aber schnell gewöhnt.Im Verlauf gab es einige Überraschungen und auch das Ende gehörte für mich nicht unbedingt zu den vorhersehbarsten. Alles in allem fand ich das Buch durchaus überzeugend. Übrigens ist auch schon eine Verfilmung geplant, die ich mir dann gerne anschauen würde.*Rezensionsexemplar"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.904234"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.904234"]]

Debo decir que al libro le cuesta un poco arrancar y tarda demasiado en centrar la historia, por tanto si os decidís a leerlo, no tiréis la toalla a la primera de cambio porque a partir de la página 100 se pone más interesante y empiezan a suceder bastantes cosas. Tengo sensaciones muy encontradas respecto a este libro. En ocasiones lo encontraba un poco plano pero el final me convenció bastante y le dio sentido a todo. Pero a pesar de ser un thriller, creo que es uno de esos libros que necesitan reposar unos días para reflexionar sobre él. Para que os hagáis una idea, sería el resultado de meter en una batidora a: \"La magia del orden\" de Marie Kondo, \"50 sombras de Grey\" y un thriller de moda como podría ser \"La chica del tren\" o \"El método 15/33\" de Shannon Kirk.Los personajes son bastante oscuros y todos tienen mucho que ocultar, es complicado saber cuánto hay de cierto en las palabras de cada uno. Las víctimas se vuelven verdugos, y viceversa, en un abrir y cerrar de ojos.Os preguntaréis si era predecible, pero normalmente procuro dejarme llevar por la historia sin pensar más allá y, en este caso, como lo leí prácticamente en el mismo día, tampoco tuve mucho tiempo para armarme mis teorías. Muchas veces hay que meterse en las historias sin intentar adivinar lo que está pasando y dejar que la historia sea la que te sorprenda.En resumen: si os gustan los thrillers es una lectura obligatoria.

The presentation of the story definitely hooked me as there were two narrators and two timelines. That said, both women bore striking resemblances to one another in appearances and experiences. This strengthened my belief that it was a plot I'd already read. Then things started to change shape. None of the characters are particularly likeable but the narrators also turn out to be somewhat unreliable which I found intriguing as I looked at the way information was cleverly presented to the reader to lead the thought process off direction without the narrator changing the story within her own head. The sex is a little too salacious for my taste yet details were sparse, innuendo doing the most work. Besides the sex, the book offered a compelling thriller with story twists I didn't see coming, red herrings planted just so, then discredited, then questioned, then new possibilities arise...Solid thriller.

Delaney's THE GIRL BEFORE has such an alluring premise and there moments where I couldn't put it down. But the far-fetched plot points, pseudo-sexual dominant storyline, and over-abundance of twists and turns left me feeling less than enthused about the novel overall.The story follows Emma and Jane, two women separated by time. In the past, Emma, who is still suffering the effects of a recent home invasion, moves into One Folgate Street with her adoring boyfriend. In the present, Jane is recovering from the loss of her child and hoping to start anew in the house. Designed by renowned minimalist architect, Edward Monkford, One Folgate Street is well-known in the London renter's market. But its occupants—the ones who get through vigorous application process—must abide by an exhaustive list of terms and conditions. Jane becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Emma, the girl before her. But the closer she gets to the truth, trouble follows her putting her life in danger. Is Edward a psychopath desperate for control? Or is there something else going on?On one hand, I reached a point in THE GIRL BEFORE (albeit late in the novel) and I absolutely couldn't put it down. Like Jane, I was desperate to find out Emma's truth. What exactly happened to her? Why was Jane's experiences in the house almost identical to Emma's?But what I wasn't expecting was to be given a dark sexual storyline (just FYI—it's not a romance), that came out of nowhere. It was bizarre. That aspect of the book really threw me for a loop and it wasn't something I enjoyed at all, especially all the \"Yes, Daddy\" talk.I liked the duplicitous characterization that played out in the novel. That led to some interesting revelations for the reader. The transitions between the alternating points of view was seamless, but sometimes due to the characters' almost parallel storylines it was confusing at times to distinguish the two women's story arcs.\n  There was a time when One Folgate Street seemed like a calm, serene haven. Now it doesn't. It feels claustrophobic and mean. Like the house is angry with me.\nEmma's chapters are written without quotation marks, something that was a deliberate choice of style. Though, I'm not sure what it was meant to accomplish. A form of minimalism? To emphasize that she no longer had a voice in the present time? This took some time getting used to and it made it a little more difficult to read. Had I completely understood this writing style choice, maybe I could be more forgiving, but it didn't really make sense to me. The ending felt really rush and, if I'm honest, contrived where Jane was concerned.. We're given almost no resolution with Edward's character, which was disappointing to me.I can definitely see the commercial appeal of this novel and hence, why there is a movie deal. It's a blend of a dark sexual thriller and a whodunit with suspects and motives in every direction. But several plot points didn't work for me and didn't enjoy the book as a whole.*  Thanks to Ballantine Books for the chance to read an early copy.

This book tells the story of Emma before and Jane Now. Both women who have had traumatic things happen to them in their lives and through a long application process are able to rent One Folgate Street. A home built by an eccentric architect who suffered the loss of his wife and son. The home is very stark and occupants must abide by a very long rental agreement.EmmaEmma moves into One Folgate Street with her boyfriend, Simon, after a break in at their home. Soon things start to change and Emma begins a relationship with the strange, handsome architect.JaneJane moves into One Folgate Street after a traumatic loss. She finds the home to be interesting but not as interesting as the architect and the story of the loss of his wife and his relationship with it's former occupant, Emma.I loved how the chapters flipped back and forth between the two women's stories. This made the book a very fast read. Things never got dull. There really is not down time in this book. No long descriptions, no wordy prose. It was actually quite nice to read a bit about one woman in the past and then read about the other woman in the future. Sometimes when books have multiple POW's being told it gets tedious. Not in this book. This is this books strong point IMO. Though going back and forth in time and reading each woman's POW, it soon becomes apparent that the two women are tied together somehow. Even the house itself is like a character in the book as it is built to learn about them and to help make them \"better\".Not everyone is as they seem in this book. I really loved that aspect. Who is telling the truth? Who is the wolf in sheep's clothing? What really happens? Who can we trust? I really enjoyed the twists and turns. This was a very fast read. Very enjoyable and well thought out. Is it the best book I have ever read? No, certainly not but it is a very enjoyable book. Sometimes it is just a pleasure to sit and read a book that grabs one's attention, is entertaining and makes one think.

For one of the first times, I decided to look at reviews before I read. I’m not sure why there are comparisons to Gone Girl or the Girl on the Train beyond the titles, though there is a similar tone in voice to Girl on the Train. That aside, I do think Gone Girl and Girl on the Train were stronger in suspense and tension and also in dealing with psycholical aspects of their characters. But I'm no psychologist so who knows.The setting, a house, in this story is as much a character as the two protagonists, Emma and Jane. They both come and live in One Folgate Street — a perfect and beautiful ultra-minimalist house designed by an obsessive and enigmatic architect named Edward. The house can sense their moods, changes lightning, trace their steps through the house, and monitor everything from the tenants weight, items in the fridge in the cupboard and a host of things that would take a special tenant to cope with. It also has a state of the art security system.Emma, we learn from the blurb, has died in the house after living there for a period with her boyfriend. When Jane comes to live there a few years after Emma’s death it’s hard not to wonder how Emma really died and if Jane will suffer the same fate. I did decide that I knew who the antagonist was very early. This was a little disappointing, and there was a moment two thirds of the way through, where I became very weary of Emma’s constant change of story and at one point it became completely illogical to me --- but that moment passed to some degree, and when it was made clear who the antagonist was, I had that sense of dread till near the ending."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.952376"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.952376"]]

After the deaths of his wife and child, Monkford starts leasing out the house, but he is very particular about the tenants. They all seem to be female and they all must agree to an elaborate set of conditions in the lease. The book is told in alternating chapters by two tenants, Emma (the girl before) and Jane. My initial problem with the book was that Emma and Jane aren't girls. They are grown-ass women who should not be so stupid..the whole premise of the book is ridiculous. Unless you have been homeless and living on the streets for six months you would not be desperate enough to sign a lease with 200 conditions with respect to which you will be punished if you do not comply Your mandatory cleaning service is required to spy on you and report infractions to the landlord. And for this you get to live in a house that would make an egg look over decorated. Also sex with Monkford seems to be an unwritten part of the deal (not that either Emma or Jane showed the slightest reluctance). I should know better than to try to read books with \"girl\" in the title. A lot of sex and two incredibly stupid women - this book was definitely not for me.

I received a gorgeous copy of The Girl Before when I was at Harrogate last year, it’s totally white apart from the orange edged pages and the title and authors name are embossed on the cover. But even if I thought that the visual appearance of my copy was stunning it didn’t prepare me for the perfectly pitched plot on the inside. Goodness me I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK! I may even keep it beside me for a little bit longer-I’m not quite sure I’m ready to let it go just yet!Everything about this book worked for me, apart from one little thing and I’ll come to that later! I loved the dual plot thread of Emma (Then) and Jane (Now). Emma’s story felt almost theatrical, and with no speech marks in her chapters there was also a more voyeuristic feeling. That, combined with the sense of creepiness that builds gradually, made me feel as though we were also part of the “housekeeping”in the home that separates the two women by three years. I felt more of a connection to Jane from the very start and have to say that I felt her experiences were handled in a very compassionate and perceptive manner. She was my perfect heroine, intelligent, fearless and strong minded but never easily interpreted.This was a perfect “read in one addictive session” book as I was desperate to find out what secrets the house at One Folgate Street was hiding. Watching the dual stories of Emma and Jane come crashing together was utterly compelling. The one teeny tiny little fly in the ointment for me was Edward, a character that I found to be a little too “Christian Grey” at times, more of a caricature than I would have liked but weirdly enough, he did work within this whole concept of control that ran through the narrative. I couldn’t imagine either of the women falling so deeply under his spell, there was little charisma there for me but each to their own I suppose!  Just don’t get me started on the list of questions that sat in judgement at the start of each chapter! My moral compass definitely found them to be a little more challenging than I would have liked and they certainly caused some rather heated debates within this household!I’ve read that Ron Howard is going to be directing the film version of this book. Now, I have a great respect for him as a director so he had better do this book justice! I’m particularly worried about comparisons with The Girl on The Train as I really didn’t find that film version sympathetic to the book. I do hope that they don’t make the same error here in relocating the setting to New York. Or similar. One of the things I loved about this book was the whole architectural concept, the house at One Folgate Street and the city of London, incorporating the museums, which all seemed so quintessentially British to me so I will be keeping everything crossed!This dark and sometimes disturbing book is proving to be a bit of a Marmite read, having now looked at what other reviewers are saying. It surprised me by surpassing my expectations so I’m sticking my head above the parapet and saying I LOVED IT! So, J P Delaney, whoever you are, I’d like more of the same please!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.975024"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.975024"]]

I enjoyed every page of this thriller.The story is narrated by the two main characters Emma and Jane in a typical Now amp; Then style (where Emma is “then” and Jane is “now”). So, both girls are looking for a new place to move in. Each one suffering some personal trauma and seeking a new start in a new home. After a lot of search, each in her own time finally reaches One Folgate Street, which is beyond perfect. It’s very calming with perfect design. A masterpiece. A dream comes true. However, the owner has terms. Very strict rules actually. As bizarre as this seems, each girl, desperate to be the tenant of this masterpiece, approves to the terms and gets into the process of the application and interview hoping to be the lucky accepted tenant. And what a happy surprise for each to be asked to an interview with the owner and then accepted as the new tenant.Jane is attracted to the handsome seductive owner at once. He is too. And thus, their relation starts. But Jane has her doubts when she knows about the previous tenant and the mysterious crime. As she searches for the truth, she takes the reader with her in a roller coaster of twists and turns where nothing is what it seems to be. I loved this roller coaster a lot. I tried to be the smart girl all along and guess what’s next. Whenever I thought “That’s it. Got you!!” I found my guessing to be wrong. Ha! I always love the double narration and the now and then style. I was caught in and desperate to know what’s next.The handsome seductive owner of One Folgate Street is another issue. He is dark, mysterious yet you can’t help but love him. This is one of the few times when you just like the supposedly villain of the novel. Just like in “Jane Eyre”, or was I the only one who loved Rochester?I also loved the End. I will not be the silly girl who spoils it for you. I will only say that I liked it.The audiobook was also great. I loved listening to it going back and forth between the audiobook and the eBook.Finally, for those who enjoy psychological thrillers, you should read The Girl Before. I highly recommend it.** Special thanks to NetGalley amp; Ballantine Books for supplying my copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review **For all my reviews please visit http://www.meshascorner.net"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.978513"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.978513"]]

Its tormented twistiness tugs at the fraying strings of the characters as they live in the shadow of a peculiar architect’s unconventional vision of perfection.Two distinctive, yet interchangeable, time periods, “then: Emma” and “now: Jane”, begin to reveal the secrets of One Folgate Street. The property itself is quite extraordinary, but so are the uncompromising terms which must be obeyed in accordance to a restricted covenant detailing specific demands of anyone who is granted permission to live there.Emma and her boyfriend Simon, the previous tenants, were at the centre of a break in at their previous home. Emma needs to feel safer and the hi-tec security of this new property offered that, it’s just the rest of their lives that needed fixing. Jane, the current tenant, suffered a stillbirth. She’s grieving and is striving to start again. A clean slate she what she needs, with nothing holding her back just a genuine desire to be content, process her loss, and try to curb her curiosity about the death of The Girl Before.Is it possible for any tenant, no matter how meticulous the selection process, to live up the high standards of such a minimalistic environment, bordering on an impossible regime? Even after jumping through hoops, can they truly reap the full benefits of living in this pristine, clutter free, and questionably affordable property?Well, we soon discover the answer to that question as we meet the key characters desperate to change their lives when completing a curious questionnaire, which initially tests their integrity for selection to their first interview. However, the psychoanalysis continues while they live at One Folgate Street, assessing their quality of life and whether it has improved since becoming a resident.The reasoning behind the odd rules and why these particular individuals were selected is drip fed into their blurring stories. It’s as though the architect’s desire for perfection for the building and the tenant becomes inseparable. The inflexible, obsessive, supremacy of Edward Monkton knows exactly how he wants his plans to perform and there are certain parts of his tenants’ lives that are surplus to requirements.The psychological drama rattles unremittingly until its toxic snake bite of an ending. For a simple catalyst of property hunting to ignite such a perfect spark of intrigue is just pure genius.

After a personal tragedy takes a hold in her life, Jane decides to make a few changes. She leaves her job for another and decides to also leave her home, beginning her search for somewhere better. Upon house hunting, a real estate agent offers her a look into One Folgate Street, where the demands of the house are quite odd, but the house itself made architecturally stunning. Jane takes up the offer on the house and soon finds that there's something eery about a place that's too perfect.

There have been so many \"girl\" books as of late, that sort of always have the same plot and not much of just being thrilling.However, once I began reading, I had a feeling this one was it for me despite not being able to pick up a thriller for quite some time.Immediately, I was hooked. This story was fast-paced and intriguing, so much so that I found myself up late at night unable to put it down, for fear of not being able to catch up and find out all of the answers. I enjoyed the story being told in Emma's (then) and Jane's (now) point of view. I did not find myself getting confused, even though throughout the book you find parallels between the two women and their lives. Though these women are both so different, you can see what similar decisions they make that lead them to ultimately begin living the same life.The writing and the characters were it for me. At times there was such dark writing as we get to see more of Jane's and Emma's history and what has brought them to One Folgate Street, and then we see this vivid writing with details of architectural work and character descriptions.I even became slightly interested in architecture along the way, so props to that! I very much enjoyed Jane, more than Emma, and found myself rooting for her towards finding answers and getting herself out of fate's way. She has this strong independence in her that you don't see in Emma, or in any other character, that I loved.Overall, I had a really great reading experience and I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a thrill. The writing, the characters, the mood will get you hooked and even you'll find yourself marveling at the odd wonder of One Folgate Street."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.992285"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:16.992285"]]

However, found it a bit impossible to believe at some points, sounded like a TV drama more than a thriller. I found myself thinking - really? People cant possibly be that stupid, right? Or I am just naive. So yes, I found one of the main characters annoying. Very annoying, she just could not decide what kind of person she is, and that melodramatic jumping from being broken victim to strong crazy sexy woman was ridiculous.

Delaney estreia-se no mundo editorial com A Rapariga de Antes, um thriller psicológico que tem tido bastante aceitação da parte dos leitores, após a sua publicação no início deste ano. Na realidade, trata-te de um pseudónimo do autor inglês Tony Strong, que para além de publicar com o seu nome, tem vários livros editados com o pseudónimo Anthony Capella (também publicado em Portugal).Por causa do hype em redor deste lançamento e porque recentemente este género me tem revelado boas surpresas, a minha curiosidade ficou bastante aguçada e foi com avidez que iniciei esta leitura. A narrativa alterna capítulos sob o ponto de vista de duas mulheres, Emma no passado e Jane no presente, enquanto o leitor vai acompanhando a ida de ambas para o n.º 1 Folgate Street, uma casa londrina bastante sui generis e que desde o início do livro parece tanto uma personagem real como as duas mulheres.Esta casa é uma criação única do afamado arquiteto Edward Monkford, que só permite que alguém lá resida se cumprir uma série de requisitos e se comprometer a seguir várias regras para lá morar. Tanto Emma como Jane passam no teste e acabam por se envolver com Edward, assumindo a história um paralelismo afetado pelo ambiente peculiar da casa. Jane acaba por saber que a anterior inquilina, Emma, morreu dentro da casa em condições algo estranhas e decide investigar o passado de Emma, o que a leva a caminhos sinuosos e cheios de revelações.A Rapariga de Antes é um livro que fala de obsessões. A mais evidente é a obsessão pelo minimalismo da parte de Edward, fruto do seu transtorno obsessivo-compulsivo. A casa é um reflexo dessa sua faceta, aqui levada ao extremo não só pelas várias exigências que faz aos seus inquilinos, mas também pela tecnologia presente, que parece esconder sob a capa da inovação e modernismo a invasão da privacidade dos seus moradores. Mas também há personagens com obsessão pela mentira, por uma pessoa em particular ou por determinadas práticas sexuais.Foi um livro que li num ápice, curiosa por saber o que, afinal de contas, tinha acontecido a Emma. Gostei bastante do início do livro, em especial pelo ambiente algo sinistro que o autor consegue criar, mas pareceu-me que a difícil tarefa de o manter ao longo de todo o livro acabou por não ser completamente bem sucedida. No final de contas, é um thriller psicológico interessante, com boas ideias e que, apesar de não ser perfeito, proporcionou boas horas de leitura."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.047052"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.047052"]]

The Girl Before is a fascinatingly frustrating read wherein the narrative is so much more clever and compelling than any of its characters, particularly the main two heroines, the girl before, Emma, and the girl after, Jane. Those two are just...insipid, infuriating, maddening. The book itself is essentially Fifty Shades of Grey with architecture. Both Emma and Jane in their respective timelines, which are precision interweaved throughout the story, occasionally dizzyingly so, fall for an obsessive compulsive domineering architect with Samp;M tendencies, Edward, after coming to live in his showcase of a house. Appropriately both the house and its creator have all the charm and warmth of a particularly ascetic modern design, you know the sort with limited number of uncomfortable overpriced furniture and slick austere nothingness. Yeah, that, apparently irresistible to a certain type of women, someone's who's undergone a recent tragedy, for example. And so the games begin...while Edward can't be entirely trusted, neither can as it turns out anyone. Delaney muddies the waters with unreliable narrators and suspense, so you just have to find out what's going on, and to her credit she does create a dynamic fun sort of a thriller, almost in spite of her oversexed imbecile characters. And so as entertaining as it was, the estrogen just overwhelmed it much too much for it to be genuinely good. Maybe I'm not its typical target audience. This was quite possibly meant for those who thought Fifty Shades of Grey needed some suspense and a murder or two. Maybe I shouldn't be referring to the book I haven't actually read, but I know the gist, doesn't everyone by now. At any rate shame to see an obviously talented author limiting herself to a trend, trends are stupid for the most part anyway, but surely money talks and all that.

One has shadowy parents, neither has siblings, and they are neatly set adrift with minimal back story in north west London, where we all know that the rents are high and the people unfriendly, apart from the single chatty neighbour.The architectural context could have been interesting but it was confined to some superficial descriptions of buildings (all of which involved \"pale stone\": could have done with some editing, I think) and lists of names of famous architects. A smattering of medical jargon was thrown in for good measure.As for the plot, the true villain was obvious to me from the earliest pages.

I absolutely could not put this book down and finished it in three days instead of one only because I had to go to work.The story is based around a house located at One Folgate Street. There are two women who apply to live in the house and the story is told from their points of view from the time they apply to the time they leave the house. In order to live in the house, applicants must agree to a long list of rules that were created by the builder who originally built the house to live in with his now deceased wife and son. Emma, lives in the house first with her boyfriend Simon. Then several years later, Jane lives in the house. The fact that the two women look alike and also look like the builder’s deceased wife with dark hair and blue eyes is slightly unsettling. I really enjoyed reading this book because the characters came to life through the author’s writing. I could imagine the open floor plan of the house and each room from the kitchen (they called it something else in the book) to the bathroom with the sensor-activated shower head to the hidden panel that lead to the mop and broom closet. The answer seems so obvious to what happened to Emma, so of course, I knew there had to be a plot twist.

An architecturally interesting house is yours for an incredibly low rent if you answer pages of personal questions, agree to live by an enormous number of rules, and somehow please the architect.

Juxtaposing the lives and experiences of these two different women inside of the same house at different times was fascinating. A peek into the suspicious death of the architect's wife and child added to the intrigue. And now the negatives: at the half way point suddenly the story seemed trite. Edward the architect suddenly starts sounding like Christian Grey (of 50 Shades fame). A psychotherapist willingly shares notes from Emma's sessions with Jane.

Yes, it’s an above average psychological thriller, just barely. It’s a story of two women who have previously been traumatized and want/need to move to begin anew. The story is told in alternating chapters of both characters. These ladies are drawn to this austere building that requires the completion of a complex multiple-choice questionnaire, along with pictures. In addition, there is an in-depth, multipage contract that the occupant must agree to and sign. Along with the telling of the story, the reader learns of some of the questions. The house has a history of occupants suffering traumas (aka deaths) while living in the house. As a reader, one wonders who in their right mind would go through the dog and pony show, agree to the contract, and move in. Through the description provided, the house didn’t sound that fabulous to agree to such crazy stipulations. Author JP Delaney does scrape up a thriller in the question of how previous women met their demise and who was responsible for the downfall.Nonetheless, this reader finished it. As absurd as it sounds, there is a true thriller aspect to it, if you mindlessly go along with the basic foundation. Do I recommend it? Not really. There are far better thrillers out there.

I’m still glad I ended up reading it, but it definitely wasn’t as good as I was expecting, and ended up being more of a fence sitter.The story is told through alternating POV. The newest resident of One Folgate Street, Jane, and the girl before, Emma. We know right from the get go something had to have happened, obviously, because One Folgate Street is back on the market and not still being lived in by Emma. I found the premise of the house itself to be more intriguing than the lives of the women and the people in their lives. Hell, I wanted to move into One Folgate Street after reading the descriptions of the location and how the house itself was set up.This is tagged as mystery/thriller/suspense, and really all of that revolves around Jane trying to figure out what happened to Emma. The author really tries to make the reader suspect one person right from the get-go, but I’ve read too many mysteries to fall for it, and gradually came to the conclusion myself who the perp was before it was revealed.Overall, when I finished the story I was left with the thought that you really never know anyone 100%, and Every. Single. Person. has secrets. Ever person in this story has had something traumatic happen to them:-Emma: House was broken into and she no longer feels safe.-Jane: Had a personal tragedy regarding a pregnancy.-The Architect: Lost his wife and child years before in an architecture related accident.But when it really came down to it, I kinda felt like the architect was the only one that was sort of coping with what happened to them, and trying to move on. Emma and Jane always came off to me like they were just trying to fill a void in their lives, rather than accepting the fact that you can’t fill the voids that struggles have left you with. Square peg, round hole. A thing can never be broken or cracked and be remade to be exactly what it was before.I would recommend this book to those who don’t have strong background in reading mystery. I think those readers are the ones that would enjoy this the most. I guess I’m just too jaded so everything was really obvious to me. Still really happy I read this, finally, and would most likely look into something else from this author.Copy received through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.110813"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.110813"]]

I had heard such good things about it and I honestly didn't want to be disappointed. Too much hype surrounding a book release often leads to let down in my literary experience. I’m happy to say, this book was well worth all the buzz and more! However, now I need to try to sum up my reading experience without ruining it for anyone else….hmmmmm. Here I go!The Girl Before alternated seamlessly chapter by chapter between its two main characters, Emma and Jane. The story was told both in the present day with Jane and in the past with Emma. Both women were reeling from personal tragedy and searching for big changes in their lives. Jane was looking for a new place to live after suffering through the stillbirth of her first child. Emma had experienced a home invasion and was held at knife point. The exact events that occurred during the attack have been blurred by trauma. She wanted to remember the attack, but also forget at the same time.At the different times in the book, both of the women were shown the same home...the spectacular minimalistic house - One Folgate Street. The house was extraordinary. The house was the winner of architectural awards, its design was simple and sleek. But this house had a violent history and a determined, unwavering owner, Edward Monkford. Edward had a reputation of being a handful to deal with. The application process, the rules, and the way of life that the Edward demanded of you to live in this house, would have made the average person run away screaming. But not these two, they were blinded by the house's beauty and the idea of a simplistic lifestyle allured their senses.The twisting tale of these women and their experiences with the house and Edward kept me up at night, and reading until the wee hours of the morning. In my personal down times, I found myself contemplating where the plot was heading, and who was the true villain in the story? I changed my mind over and over. If you were to ask me, that's the true sign of great storytelling! That and the fact that I feel like I can't put all my thoughts on this one into this one review. It would be a disservice to how good this book was!Now, with that being said I don't think this book is for every reader - as most aren’t. I think people who enjoy mystery and thrillers will like it. The people who like to identify with the characters in the book may not. I personally didn't really like any of the characters. Jane was probably the most likeable for me. Edward was a big double thumbs down, a real turn off for me! I don't care how good looking and powerful you are or pretend to be, no one is going to tell me how to live! End of story!

Emma has just experienced a traumatic break in at her flat and is looking for a new place to live, but can’t seem to find something that is both affordable and feels safe to her. Until she looks at One Folate Street. The house is a minimalist design made of pale stone, high ceilings, plate glass and a very open floor plan and is considered to be an architectural masterpiece.But the enigmatic architect who designed the house has over 200 rules for living there, including no books, no photos, no clutter, no throw pillows or other personal effects as the house is meant to transform it’s occupant. Jane has just suffered a personal tragedy and is looking for a fresh start, which she believes she has found at One Folate Street. The space seems to bring her a sense of calm that she hasn’t felt in a while and she also feels drawn to the architect who created it. Shortly after moving in, Jane learns about the death of the home’s previous tenant; a woman who has a similar appearance to her. As Jane begins to investigate what happened, she has to untangle the truth from all the lies. She unknowingly begins to the follow the same patterns, make the same choices and cross paths with the same people and also begins to experience the same terror, as the girl before.I received an ARC of The Girl Before about 3 months ago and I so wish I had read it sooner because I absolutely loved it. It was not at all what I expected it to be. The story, as mentioned above, is told from two perspectives; Then: Emma and Now:Jane. So the perspectives switch every other chapter but it was very easy to follow alone. Also, in between most chapters is a question from the application package when the girls applied to One Folate Street and from the follow up surveys the girls filled out while living there. I also thought that was a nice touch and some of the questions did make me stop and think for a moment. I don’t want to give too much of the plot away but I do want to mention a few things. I really liked the author’s writing style and I felt that even though we split time between Emma and Jane, we got to know their characters pretty well. The architect, Edward, is also a very interesting character. This was one of those books that I could not stop reading because every time I thought I had the plot twists figured out, it would go in a different direction. I read almost the whole book in one day. It really captivated my attention. I can honestly say most of the plot twists I didn’t figure out until they happened and the author did a really good job with that. And the ending was also pretty good, not as dramatic as I had expected it to be, but unexpected. There is some sex in this book, which I like to mention when it’s a book that I normally wouldn’t expect to contain detailed sexual encounters. The scenes are all well done and it is nothing over the top. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.Thank you to the publisher for sending me an advanced reading copy of this book."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.129790"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.129790"]]

Years apart, each woman applies to be a tenant and each woman develop their own relationship with the man behind the design, Edward Monkford. When Jane finds out that years earlier, the previous tenant, Emma, died in the home, she begins investigating the death. Untangling a web of lies, she follows down a similar path and soon finds herself in the same danger as the girl before.The Girl Before, by JP Delaney (a pseudonym), is a book that has been getting consistent amounts of buzz in the book blogging world; I was dying to read this one!I was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy and I have to say, I have some seriously mixed feelings about this book. I found myself feeling equal parts mesmerized and strange while I was reading. What I Liked:  The Narration: the novel is narrated with alternating viewpoints from tenants at One Folgate Street: Jane, the present tenant and from Emma, the woman who lived there previously. This technique kept me glued to this book. The segmented chapters are short and sweet and use the right amount of hook to carry the story along. As the women’s experiences begin to mirror each other, things become creepy really quickly. Throwback to Gothic Literature: Fun Fact. I have always been a fan of classic gothic fiction and this novel certainly resonates with this genre. From the massive, sterile house to our female protagonists threatened by a powerful, tyrannical male, this one had moments where it read like Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho. I really liked how this one gave a modern twist on the gothic novel and combined it with the domestic thriller genre that has swept 2016 by storm.What I Didn’t Like:  Kind of gave me a Fifty Shades of Grey vibe: Edward Monkford was Christian Grey to me. The novel had moments where sexual domination took the lead and the actual story took the backburner. I have a very hard time taking a book seriously when the character, which is supposed to be the antagonist, is consistently referred to as “Daddy”. I feel like I would have enjoyed the book much more if this part of the book had taken on a smaller role. Regardless of my feelings about that portion of the book, I cannot deny that this one kept me up, late into the night, to finish. I was consumed by the plot and need to find out what happened. It already has the movie rights sold, so I will be intrigued to see how this will play out on the big screen. If you are a fan of a dark, twisting thriller, then I would recommend this book. However, if you hated the idea of Fifty Shades of Grey, then chances are, you will not appreciate this one either! Thank you to Penguin Random House Canada and the author, JP Delaney, for a copy of this one!

For Emma, she requires a safe place after being the victim of a break-in while her loyal boyfriend, Simon, was out. For Jane, it is a new place that holds no reminders of the baby she lost. For each woman, the house at One Folgate Street seems to offer exactly what they are looking for. It is designed by well-known architect, Edward Monkford, and comes with a set of rules created by the inscrutable man himself. In fact, to live at One Folgate Streets means signing off on over 200 rules, ranging from no books or personal mementos, to total tidiness, to agreeing to showing the house on architectural tours, to accepting to the intense technology that it comes with, including the house monitoring your well-being and moods. At first, the rules and clarity that come with One Folgate Street seem comforting to Emma and Jane. But as they spend more time in the house--and learn about its past, including its mysterious builder--they become terrifying and stifling. THE GIRL BEFORE is a fascinating novel told solely from the point of view of Emma, One Folgate Street's previous tenant, and Jane, its current tenant. All activities are filtered through the lens of these two women. The novel effectively builds suspense with the parallel nature of the two women's stories, but it also can get a little repetitive at times (and sometimes a little confusing, as you have to remind yourself, mostly in the beginning, who is talking). The book starts off exciting, as you are drawn into both Emma and Jane's tales while they acclimate to the house and all the oddities it offers. The house itself almost becomes another character in the novel. It starts to drag a bit halfway through as you wonder what will happen in the next half (people living in a technologically advanced house can only be so exciting, right?). But then, suddenly, the novel takes some odd turns (there are some interesting sexual plot twists) and eventually grows quite interesting again with some psychological and thrilling revelations. Perhaps my favorite part about this book is that many of these developments truly surprised me, which isn't always easy to do in a thriller. Overall, this is an interesting novel. It's certainly suspenseful and different. To enjoy it, you really have to set your disbelief aside at the actual conditions of living at One Folgate Street (no books, what?!) and accept that the two women are so broken (and perhaps broke, as the house apparently comes at a great discount) that they will go along with anything. It has a lot of varied plot threads and some of them aren't always fully explored or truly necessary, which can be a little frustrating. Still, the book truly surprised me with its twists and kept me entertained, with a deep desire to get to the end. Overall, 3.5+ stars.

While this book is being touted as the next Gone Girl/Girl on the Train (which is becoming tiresomely overused), I wish it would have been advertised as the next Fifty Shades of Grey so I would have known to steer clear. I am not surprised at all to see this novel being made into a movie adaptation and I suspect it will be quite well received by many. The relationship aspect, which was a huge part of the novel, was just not for me. I don't typically enjoy emotionally damaged women that are helpless to the charms of men simply because they are rich and handsome, nor do I enjoy novels reflecting such an uneven balance of power and/or huge red flags for an abusive relationship but the women stay because the sex is good. So those parts of the story just did not work for me. I will say, however, the mystery aspect of this book is really well done here - the plot really keeps you guessing (I didn't figure out some things until the very end) and the use of the house as a character is really very clever and effective. There is a certain level of voyeurism at play with the reader - I particularly liked playing along with the quizzes/moral dilemmas - a very successful plot device - and the introduction of life choices (how does one evaluate possessions). I also now want to incorporate karesansui into my next home (I love being introduced to new concepts). But I found myself enraged at one character that literally eats food that is absolutely abhorrent to her because she thinks it will turn a man on and another character that grossly misrepresents a sexual assault.

But this one intrigued me, and I'm glad I took the chance. This is a unique, beautifully told story.The book is written in alternating timelines, both in first person. Each character has a distinct voice and a strong personality. I didn't particularly like either woman, in that I wouldn't choose to hang out with them in my real life, so the fact that I enjoyed spending time with them fictionally speaks volumes about the author's storytelling talent. I found Jane to be a much more sympathetic character, and some of her scenes in particular were incredibly powerful. Both characters are complex and well developed.As I write this, the pre-publication promotion touts this book as a psychological thriller. 'Thriller' doesn't fit. It's far more of a slow-burning suspense. This is the type of book that gets under your skin with foreboding darkness, the hint of things to come, and the way the characters, and we as readers, remain slightly off balance throughout. Much of the story takes place within the house at One Folgate Street, with its minimalist design and enforced lifestyle. I was fascinated by the author's approach to this unique concept as a foundation for the story.My only grumbling point is a stylistic choice made by the author. Delaney does not use quotation marks for dialogue throughout Emma's POV sections. I came across this method once before in experimental literary fiction. I didn't like it then, and I didn't like it this time either. Quotation marks are subtle reading cues we don't even notice until they're missing. Their absence forced me to think more in order to figure out if sentences were being spoken aloud, thought, or were part of the narration. For me, this hurt the story's flow, as I was constantly questioning the way I interpreted things. Jane's POV sections do have quotation marks for the dialogue, so I'm not sure what the point was in choosing not to use them for Emma's parts.*I was provided with an advance ebook copy by the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for my honest review.*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.145146"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.145146"]]

One Folgate Street is an architectural masterpiece, completely minimalist in its design. But, the owner of the home, Edward, is incredibly controlling and finicky about who can live there. To be considered as a tenant for the house you must fill out a questionnaire than can only be described as bizarre and intrusive. And, there are rules to living at One Folgate Street. No throw pillows, no pets, no photos, no clutter and no books just to name a few. The story follows two women’s tenures at One Folgate Street – Emma, who is recovering from a traumatic break in and searched out a new place to call home, is the “before” and Jane, recovering from a personal tragedy, is the “now”. After Jane realizes that Emma had met a deathly end inside One Folgate Street she starts to do some investigating into Emma and what she finds is unsettling. I won’t really go into any further detail on the plot but this book is incredibly creepy and will have you hooked until the end. I couldn’t read it fast enough. Is the owner/designer of the house a dangerous man? Or is he just controlling? Was Emma murdered? Was her death an accident? Does the house have a mind of its own? There is an element here that reminded me of 50 Shades of Grey when the story delves into the sexual relationship that brews between Edward and both Jane and Emma; that is something I could have done without. This is going to be made into a movie adaptation and I think it will be a really good, creepy movie.

I was kept on my toes all the way til the end of the book and loved the little twists thrown in at the end.

Both experienced tragedies before moving into the home. They had to fill out questionnaires and send pictures and agree to a slew of rules to even be considered as renters (no simple credit check and steady job could get them into this sterile, odd place). The home won architectural awards, but residents who live there can’t leave dishes out—even the cleaning supplies are well hidden in a secret wall panel. There aren’t even book cases—no clutter is allowed whatsoever. I couldn’t imagine living like that (I wouldn’t make it a day), but both women are in dire financial situations, and the home is modestly priced because no one would live there with the millions of rules if they could afford a normal place. I couldn’t identify with Emma or Jane or the architect of the home, Edward, who is a perfectionist and possibly a sociopath (hence the creep factor).There were some nice twists and turns I didn’t see coming, which is great, but I didn’t fall in love with the ending.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jun 07, 2017"], ["review_text", "Just another thriller to add to the growing pile of subpar genre fiction. All the publishers seem focussed at the moment on finding the next Gone Girl or Girl on the Train. This is being sold in most places as a powerful new female driven thriller, or to use a buzzword, \"domestic suspense\" The writer \"feels gratified\" at how people think HE is a woman because he wrote two women so well. Yes, JP Delaney is male, and no I don't hold that against him. What I do hold against him is the fact that I wouldn't consider writing two women who portray all the stereotypical aspects of the Hysterical Woman to be writing women well. Emma-Manipulative-Unappreciative-Sex crazed-Proned to fetishism-Compulsive liarJane-Grieving the loss of a baby-Desperately wants another baby-Focussed on her career and miss out on family and love-Calculating-SecretiveEmma and Jane-Both develop an almost instant obsession with Monkford-Both seem to have sexual awakenings because of Monkford and discover they lean toward fetishism-Both spurn the same man (Simon, and to a much lesser extent, Saul) to be with Monkford-Both give up huge amounts of personal connections in order to be with Monkford and live in Fulgate Street-Both are suspicious and deceitful I really felt, as I continued to read these two women that they are each one side of a coin, making one whole woman, who, if she lacked Emma's compulsive lying and Jane's need for a baby, might just be the perfect woman. But you throw Monkford into the mix and both women become putty for the moulding. They both lose all credibility and chance for redemption the second they let Monkford control them. These aren't well written women, they're caricatures of women that men who are anti-woman think represent or resemble women as a whole. Thematically, my interest was completely lost when the grieving mother storyline entered. Not that I don't have sympathy for any mother who has lost a child, but because I can't identify with it. I feel that this theme or subplot really alienates a large section of the female readership (which is in turn a large section of general readership of all books)I am not a woman on a quest for a child and when this becomes such a prominent storyline in any book, it's like the shutters just drop and I'm thinking \"here we go again\" the woman is having her actions explained away because \"her condition made her do it\" or maybe it was \"her fragile state of mind\" If you think this is a contentious point, look at these books for examples of exactly the same device:-Pretty Baby by Mary Kubica (proof is in the title here)-The Couple Next Door by Shari Lapena (also a second rate and utterly awful book)-The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins (she was never pregnant but many of her actions are driven by the desire for her husband's new life which includes the baby that should have been here)-Leave Me by Gayle Forman (she ditches her husband and kids because they're essentially shitty people who do nothing for her then gets involved with two other people with child related issues)It would be cool if Delaney had written these women as two different kinds of villains, which is essentially what I think he was going for, but without turning them into stereotypes. Make them utterly morally repugnant, don't just hover on the border of \"hmm maybe they'll make some questionable decisions\" it's a cop out. I liked Simon as a character, I felt he had the most depth. He was the darker side to Monkford's darkness. He masquerades as the doting, adoring boyfriend who would do anything for his girlfriend or wife when he is actually using kindness as a method of control. While Monkford is outright controlling and upfront about it from the start. I hated the ending where a new character gets introduced for one chapter. This is probably a tool left in place for potential sequels, but it really irks me. Finish books properly, a really clever writer can write a sequel without leaving themselves an entry point in their previous work, just in case they get a sequel. Also, can we stop with the alternating viewpoints please? PLEASE?! It's so tired and over done. I'm at the point where I won't buy a book if this is the method of writing. I didn't think this was a revolutionary book in any way, I resent a little the hype this was given at publisher events prior to publication because it definitely didn't live up to them. It's not the next big thing and I'm not in a hurry to read anything more by this author."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.200322"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.200322"]]

There's a lot going on and it's difficult to figure it all out. I'm still not completely sure I have it all figured out. I normally don't like books like that, which leave me with questions, but in a way, it felt right with this book. The whole book has an air of mystery and it feels ok to leave something on the table.This is also the kind of book where no one really comes out looking great.

Представете си една безупречна, фантастична къща с много светлина, простор и минималистичен стил, чийто собственик е известен архитект. На пръв поглед изглежда невъзможно точно тази перфектна къща да бъде следващото ви жилище.Модерната сграда на „Фолгейт Стрийт 1“ е като от онези снимки в списанията – изглежда недостижима и специална и в нея не може да живее всеки. Даа, сигурно трява да има някаква уловка, би било твърде хубаво, за да е истина, нали така?Изобщо не се учудвам, че романът вече е преведен на 39 езика и се е превърнал в бестселър, който предстои да бъде екранизиран под режисурата на носителя на „Оскар“ Рон Хауърд, известен с филми като „Аполо 13“, „Красив ум“ и „Шифърът на Леонардо“. И да, неслучайно сравняват „Момичето преди“ с „Не казвай сбогом“. Предричам, че много ще се говори за тази книга и тепърва ще я виждам в ръцете на мнозина – в метрото, на пейката в парка, на плажа…„Момичето преди“ е точно това, което търся в един криминален роман – необикновена история, чиято сюжетна линия да ме грабне, да ме накара да прелиствам шеметно страниците и да ме остави удовлетворена след прочита. Психологическият трилър деликатно засяга и доста социални теми, което за мен го прави още по-пълноценен. Така че, ако сте фенове на този жанр и си търсите нещо добро за четене, горещо препоръчвам да се запознаете с „Момичето преди“!Цялото ревю - тук: http://azcheta.com/momicheto-predi-dz..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.238889"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.238889"]]

Es scheint zu schön um wahr zu sein, die Wohnung ist sehr günstig und dazu noch hochmodern ausgestattet. Allerdings ist der Einzug in diese 4 Wände an eine Vielzahl von obskuren Regeln gebunden, die das Architekten Team aufgestellt hat. .Es darf nichts auf dem Boden herumliegen, es gibt keine Papierkörbe, keine Wäscheleinen und keine Sofakissen – Treppengeländer und Absicherungen stehen genauso auf der Verbotsliste wie natürlich Haustiere und Kinder. .Trotzdem überlegt Jane nicht lang, da sie sowieso ihr Leben ändern möchte und einen kompletten Neuanfang wünscht und willigt ein. .Parallel zu Janes Geschichte lesen wir immer wieder Abschnitte aus der Vergangenheit von der direkten Vormieterin Emma die auf tragische Weise in eben diesem Haus ums Leben gekommen ist. Auch Jane ist auf das Mysterium um Emmas Tod gestoßen und beginnt zu forschen. Sie findet heraus, dass die beiden Frauen sich nicht nur sehr sehr ähnlich sehen, sondern auch, dass ihre Geschichten um die Folgate Street 1 auch exakt gleich abgelaufen sind! .Bedeutet das nun etwa, dass auch Jane diesem Haus zum Opfer fallen wird? Und was hat überhaupt der verschrobene, perfektionistische aber gutaussehende Architekt Edward Monkford mit der ganzen Sache zu tun?Dieses Buch hat es geschafft, mich von der ersten bis zur Letzten Seite zu fesseln. Zwar war mir Emma nicht durchweg sympathisch, aber sie war authentisch und das ist das wichtigste! Ich habe total mitgerätselt wie das alles nun zusammenhängt und bin durch viele Wendungen gegangen die ich so nicht erahnt hätte, das Ende war sehr überraschend aber es passte perfekt und erschien nicht konstruiert.Klare Leseempfehlung von meiner Seite aus wenn ihr auf Psychothriller steht!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.241910"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.241910"]]

It was only the beginning but I could feel myself being frightened by the eerie sense the story gave. By this alone, I was amazed by how the author could do this to my reading experience so very quickly.One Folgate Street is very secure and private. It has the latest technology for the security system. The house comes with a whole set of rules and is set for a simple lifestyle without the added essentials of our lives. The house felt like a character in the story and it's what elevated the creepy feel.\"It has—well, it's a pretentious word, but it has integrity. I think he's looking for people who are prepared to be equally honest  about the way they live in.\"Emma is an unreliable, unlikable character who has issues. She went through a burglary and a possible sexual assault, which is what leads her to want to move out of her home and search for a safe place to start over. One Folgate house is the perfect place to start fresh, especially after what she went through. She meets Edward, who's the architect of the One Folgate House. Very soon, they start dating and Emma loves all the attention she receives from him. Unfortunately, something happens that ends with Emma being dead.Perhaps the house will turn me into a better person. Perhaps it will bring order and discipline to the random chaos of my life.Jane is a strong, independent, brave woman who went through a miscarriage. After the miscarriage, she quit her job and found a job in helping other mom's who go through miscarriages. Because of this, her income is low, but the prices for an apartment or house are high. One Folgate Street is the only one that Jane can afford. She sends in her application and is accepted. She feels very safe in the house and is happy with her decision of living there. When she starts seeing Edward, a few questions arise and slowly, she starts to question her relationship and her living situation.But what if the house itself decides not to protect me? How safe am I really?Edward is a controlling, manipulative man that I found myself being disgusted by. At first, I was kind of liking him and drawn to him, but when he treats Emma in the past the same way he treats Jane in the present, says the same things, gifts the same things, I was just appalled and creeped out by him. His character did enhance the eerie feel of the story, which I did like a lot. I couldn't figure out his motives and that still made him interesting to me.\"Excellence is what matters. Excellence and originality.\"The last two chapters of the story had me saying WTF so many times. I have no idea how many times I re-read those pages. I'm telling you, there's a whiplash at every turn the story makes! The story had lots of twists that had me doing a double-take and re-reading the pages because I couldn't believe what was happening.The Girl Before is a mindblowing and addicting masterpiece that left me completely transfixed and fascinated.This review was originally posted on Latte Nights Reviews."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.274299"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.274299"]]

The premise is great, if rather batty (who would honestly agree to live in a house with so many restrictive rules. You’re not allowed books! Come on!). The story is entertaining with an impressive number of twists to keep you guessing. When it comes to uncovering who was responsible for Emma’s death, there are enough plausible suspects to keep you intrigued.On the whole it’s easy to read, although the dialogue in Emma’s chapters isn’t marked off by inverted commas, which can slow the pace down as you try to separate speech from thought.And, if you like creepy, this book delivers it in spades. As the story alternates between “Emma chapters” in the past and “Jane chapters” in the present, the parallels between the women’s experiences are gradually revealed and the similarities at times, particularly in their relationships with Edward, made me shudder.However, I have issues with the sexual politics of a story in which the two main characters are largely ok with having a narcissist trying to control them. I can’t really say more than that because it could be giving away some major plot points (sorry!).I also felt things started to go haywire in the last quarter of the book as the twisting and turning went too far, pushing the plot from far-fetched to ridiculous. So while I wasn’t bored for a single second while reading The Girl Before, I have to confess to a fair bit of tutting and eye-rolling.Overall: fans of creepy psychological thrillers will love The Girl Before. I’m sure it will be very successful and I look forward to seeing how closely the upcoming film adaptation sticks to the book.Thank you to Quercus Books and NetGalley for the e-ARC."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.277425"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.277425"]]

Hier habe ich mir eine spannende und ereignisreiche Geschichte erhofft und diese auch größtenteils erhalten.Ich muss gestehen, dass ich anfangs ein paar Probleme mit der Geschichte hatte, denn der Anfang war doch sehr zäh, sodass ich mich auf den ersten 50-75 Seiten ganz schön durchbeißen musste. Danach konnte mich die Geschichte jedoch immer mehr packen, sodass ich letztendlich doch eine spannende Geschichte vorgefunden habe.Erzählt wird hierbei die Geschichte von Jane, die es im Leben nicht immer leicht hatte und von daher dringend einen Tapetenwechsel benötigt. Das Glück steht ihr dabei auf der Seite, denn sie darf in ein modernes Haus in einem angesehenen Stadtteil in London ziehen. Als sie dazu noch Edward kennen lernt, dem das Haus gehört, scheint ihr Glück zunächst perfekt zu sein, denn sie beginnt eine Affäre mit ihm und glaubt, dass ihr Leben nun besser wird. Dieses Leben beginnt jedoch immer mehr zu bröckeln, als Jane erfährt, dass es bereits eine andere Frau in diesem Haus gab, die ihr nicht nur sehr ähnlich sah, sondern dazu in dem Haus verstorben ist. Dabei kommt es auch immer zu Erlebnissen aus der Vergangenheit aus der Sicht von Emma, die in dem Haus verstorben ist.Die Geschichte ist trotz kleinerer Schwächen stets spannend. Zwar gibt es auch hier die ruhigeren Momente, die sich stellenweise ein wenig ziehen, allerdings erlebt man hier insgesamt eine interessante Geschichte mit vielseitigen Figuren, die zwar nicht immer sympathisch sind, in die man sich aber dennoch in gewisser Art und Weise hineinversetzen kann. Das Cover passt gut zur Geschichte, gleichzeitig erkennt man auch direkt das Genre und eine düstere Stimmung, was ebenfalls gut zur Geschichte passt. Die Kurzbeschreibung liest sich spannend und hat direkt mein Interesse geweckt, sodass ich \"The Girl Before\" sehr gerne eine Chance gegeben habe.Kurz gesagt: \"The Girl Before\" ist ein interessanter und spannender Thriller mit vielseitigen Figuren, der zwar am Anfang seine Zeit braucht und auch um kleinere Längen nicht herumkommt, mich aber letztendlich dennoch überzeugen konnte, sodass ich das Buch gerne gelesen haben. Wer bereits Bücher von Paula Hawkins mochte, sollte auch JP Delaney eine Chance geben!

The book tells the story of Emma and Jane, both tenants at One Folgate Street, a house that is a minimalist's and architect's dream. The house was designed by famed architect Edward Monkton. He still owns the house but rents it out to people he deems worthy. Prospective tenants have to complete a questionnaire, a personal interview, and agree to the 200 rules he imposes. Despite all the restrictions, he manages to find people who want to live there.The book alternates points of view, and chapters, between Emma and Jane. Emma is the past tenant, Jane is the current one. There are similarities between the two women. Both are victims of recent tragedies. Emma is traumatized by a recent break-in at her home that occurred while she was there. Jane by the still birth of her first child. Both women are looking for a fresh start and feel that One Folgate Street can provide that.We learn early on that Emma died in the house. It is unsure if the death was an accident, a suicide or murder. When Jane learns of Emma's death, she begins to investigate it. The alternating chapters really hi-light the similarities between Emma and Jane's experiences in the house. Seeing them making some of the same choices, really increases the tension. This book is a psychological thriller. Between Edward's increasingly controlling behavior, and what we learn about Emma and Jane's lives, the reader just doesn't know what to think. Did Edward kill Emma? Is Jane now in danger from him? Or was someone else to blame? We don't find out what actually happens until the very end.I thought this was an enjoyable book. It was fun and easy to read. The chapters were all short and fast paced. I would recommend this book to my friends who are looking for a nice escapist read.I received a free ARC from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.288131"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.288131"]]

One ended up dead and the other one who comes after her is determined to find out the truth.Sounds interesting? Yes it really is. I was really mesmerized by Edward the mysterious architect. He is possibly a psycho and I am tense waiting for the big reveleation in which he finally reveal his true self. Also this is told by the alternating POVs of Emma and Jane. We gotta read the events leading up to Emma's death. The whole story was pretty good up until that ending. Nothing really explains and I don't even understand how it all happens(view spoiler)[ What is Edward's deal? why he gotta repeat the same events with 2 different woman?What is the purpose of this house?Those are the questions been bugging me. It seems like Edward's character is merely a distraction or a decoration  (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.291001"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.291001"]]

Emma is the past resident of the house and Jane is the current resident. It was a great way to present the story.-The ending was a real surprise but it was plausible - I realized that I had missed some clues along the way.What I didn't Like - There was too much unneeded sex.-I am so tired of book titles with the word GIRLS in them when the characters are actually WOMEN.Overall, I thought it was a great read and I definitely enjoyed it.Thanks to Book Browse for a copy of this book.

Emma and Jane are two damaged women who are both separately searching for a home that will provide them with the qualities they are desperately seeking: security, safety, and peace. They find it at One Folgate Street. This story is told in two different POVs: one by Jane and the other by Emma. One of them is living in the present and the other in the past. One is still alive and the other is dead. Their reasons for searching for a peaceful, quiet and minimalist location to live in may be different, but have caused them great pain. The one thing they do share is who they fall in love with. Enigmatic, mysterious and alpha-male Edward is what most women tend to fantasize about. Edward is intelligent, successful and handsome. He lives an incredibly strict and innately detailed lifestyle. Those he chooses as tenants to live at One Folgate Street need to abide by his stringent and lengthy contract. There are very few who would be willing to give everything up to live there, but for Emma and Jane it's exactly what they're looking for.As time goes on, the beautiful and pristine home can't keep them blinded from the truth forever. As time goes on, they begin to suspect that underneath that immaculate exterior lies a secret so dark and deadly that it may cost them their lives. This was a great story! I usually love reading books that are very fast paced, but I had no problem getting absorbed into this novel. I found it to be enthralling with just the right amount of suspense and character growth.

Part of me liked it very much, a big part. But I've got some niggles with it, and in writing this review, it might help me understand my feels a bit.LikedThe state-of-the-art home where our two protagonists lived. It was a breathtakingly impressive place, which had all the gizmos and gadgets cleverly hidden away to create a perfect minimalistic living space. I'd have to break some rules to live there though. Books and cushions.Characters with unlikable traits. Yeah, I do like that. I enjoy their flawed and twisted personas and trying to fathom them out. The subtle hint of kink. Yep, these were not vanilla folk. The author brought just enough to give it some sizzle, without too much detail. Some things are best left to the readers imagination. Learning about Japanese cuisine. There's far more to it than sushi and friggin hot wasabi. (See also 'Disliked')How the two MC's POV's and stories merged as the story progressed.DislikedThe first 30-40%. I just couldn't get to grips with it! Those two girls, both with simple names, Jane and Emma. I couldn't for the life of me distinguish between them initially. I resorted to having a scrap of paper by my side whilst reading, with 'Jane, - present, Emma, - past' scribbled on it so I knew whose voice I was hearing. It's mad, it could of been just me, but I really had issues with those names. Both four letters, both very British, both rather samey. I dunno. *shrugs*It had a half-way-through-major-eyeball-rolling-moment. It was predictable and typical.Learning about Japanese cuisine. Urghhhh! Is that shit for real? No way. Nope. Stay away from my mouth.So, my conclusion is, that, yes, it was a unique story experience, with twists that kept me engrossed until the end, but it wasn't sensational.Thank you to NetGalley and Quercus Books for the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.335533"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.335533"]]

One Folgate Street was originally going to be built to be the family home of world famous architect, Edward Monkford but when his wife and child are killed, he rips up the plans and designs a unique house that molds the renter fit the house. There is an almost impossible list of questions and stipulations that must be agreed to by the prospective renter and even then it has to be approved by Edward Monkford. What first attracts people is the price. It is extremely reasonable and once they get used to the seeming austerity of the house, the beauty.The first renter in the book is Emma and her boyfriend Simon. They have just had a break-in at their current apartment that has left Emma fearful for her safety. Emma has found security problems at all the other apartments they have seen. One Folgate Street offers total security. To enter or use anything in the place they must wear a band that lets the place know you belong there. The sensors built into the house operate everything. Emma and Simon fall in love with the place and they apparently answered the questions satisfactorily as Edward Monkford approves their application. But soon after they move in, it becomes only Emma. Simon is thrown out of the picture and I believe it is mainly to do with Emma's initial attraction to Edward.The Girl Before fluctuates between Emma and Jane. The current resident is Jane and Emma is the girl before but we only learns what happened to Emma and what is happening to Jane as both their stories unfold. What happens to Jane has a lot to do with her curiosity about what happened to Emma. Both of them are wounded souls, Emma because of the break-in and Jane because of a stillborn baby.Both become intimately involved with Edward. He is very handsome, mysterious and domineering. Emma wants a man to take charge of her. She looks back on Simon as being too meek. She wants a man to dominate and protect her. She finds Edward all to willing to fill that role but he makes it very clear that he believes in short term intense relationships. Emma, like many women in relationships, believes that she will be the one to change her man. Unfortunately Emma seems to find lying easier than telling the truth and her lies start unravelling and so does her life.At one point in this book I consider putting it aside because Edward is coming across as super creepy. I decide to continue further and I'm glad I did. The book takes hold of me and pulls me in to the point where I have a hard time putting it down.Jane comes to live at One Folgate Street after the her stillborn birth of her daughter Isobel. She is vulnerable and Edward sees that and they too begin an affair. I don't understand why all these women are drawn to Edward Monkford. Too me he just comes across as creepy and the book wants you to see him as the villain of the story. Jane agrees to all of the demands asked of her to live in the house but her character is stronger than Emma's. She has noticed the similarity of Edward's deceased wife, Emma and herself. She starts investigating what happened to Emma but to keep what she's doing a secret from the house, Jane must go to a corner of her bedroom so she can use the neighbor's WiFi.In the end she survives an encounter with an unsuspected danger and proves that she was using Edward as he was using her. I am very glad that I continued reading through to the end.In the author's write up JP Delaney is revealed to be the pen names for someone who is already successful under possibly 2 different names. I thought of Nora Roberts with her JD Robb series or JK Rowling with her Cormoran Strike mysteries. It will most likely come out eventually but it is a neat twist.I received this book as a member of Suzanne Beecher's First Look Book Club and courtesy of Penguin Random House and I have given my honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.378822"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.378822"]]

In other words, I loved it. In a strange and twisted way. Just like everything is in this novel. It starts with an absurd concept, and you think, it can't get any worse but it does. Oh dear, it does. It crawls under your skin, shakes your bones, makes you sick in the night. It's messed up. In an eerie and beautiful way. Moreover, The Girl Before raises many controversial questions of the 21st century. This novel challenges you in every possible way. First, it makes you write the list of all of your essential possessions. Emphasis on essential. So, cross out that eyeliner and fuzzy slippers. Then, it makes you live in the house where 95% of people before haven't even lasted longer than a couple weeks. The house is indeed an architectural masterpiece created with a purpose of changing the resident. It's so sterile, you feel like a blank canvas - ready for a new start. And the house will either force you to start over or force you out. One Folgate Street's goal is to make your physical and emotional well-being better. That is the first question The Girl Before brings you to, shall architects create \"buildings with a sense of purpose?\"Second, it makes you a subject to a house. One Folgate Street is an amazing creation. I was absolutely fascinated by a house that monitors health and well-being of the tenant. The house is equipped with all sorts of sensors, therefore creating the most pleasant environment. The lights, the temperature, the water, the AC, the appliances - the house adjusts everything up to tenant's physical and emotional parameters. It's insane. It's beautiful. It's genius. It's future. That brings you to the second question, would collection of physical and emotional parameters with the goal of general improvement cause the conflict between privacy and technology? Third, it makes you reconsider your social choices. Because, honestly, what is going on in The Girl Before is equally messed up to Gone Girl. I am not exaggerating. It's like ice-cold water in the face, a wake-up call, a horrible realization, a gun to the head. Who do you trust? Who do you lie to? Who lies to you? All and no one. Everyone is this book is goddamn insane but so bloody real. Personalities are amplified, yes, but, honey, they are real. And they make you wonder, to what extent actions can be justified by love? I read The Girl Before on my trip to New Orleans at night. This made the reading experience even creepier. I was not able to close my eyes until the next day, and this heavy feeling was gnawing upon me the entire day. I finished the novel over three weeks ago but I still can't stop thinking about it and the residents of One Folgate Street. I feel haunted. I feel heartbroken.

The focus moves between the lives and experiences of Emma Matthews (‘Then’) and Jane Cavendish (‘Now’) at One Folgate Street in London, UK. One Folgate Street is a minimalist house designed by a reclusive architect, Edward Monkford. Those who seek to live there need to fill in a lengthy application form, and will need to abide by some 200 conditions stipulated under a restrictive covenant if their application is approved. Very few applicants are approved.‘It’s an extraordinarily tight contract.’Then: Emma Matthews likes One Folgate Place: she feels safe there. After a burglary in her last place, she is looking for security. Emma and her boyfriend Simon move in.Now: Jane Cavendish is looking for a new home. Somewhere to recover after the sudden death of her baby daughter just days before her birth.The novel shifts between ‘Then’ and ‘Now’, between Emma and Jane. Clearly Emma and Simon are no longer living at One Folgate Street when Jane moves in. But when Jane discovers that Emma died at One Folgate Street, she becomes curious about the girl who lived there before her.‘It seems One Folgate Street has a somewhat tragic history, he says.’So, what happened to Emma Matthews and her boyfriend Simon? Why are the tenancy rules so inflexible for One Folgate Street? Who is Edward Monkford, and why has he designed One Folgate Street in such a controlled, minimalist fashion? You’ll need to read the book to try to find the answers to these questions The more pages I turned, the more I became caught up in the story. My own brief obsession (I read the novel over two days) was to find out what had happened to Emma. While there are many disturbing similarities between Emma’s story and Jane’s, there are some significant differences. And just when I thought I’d worked out what happened to Emma, another twist would have me looking in another direction. It’s claustrophobic and obsessive, and I can understand why Universal has bought the film rights.Did I enjoy this novel? Yes, mostly. I had envisaged a slightly different ending, but I’m not disappointed. I’d like to know more about the author, though: J.P. Delaney is, apparently, a pseudonym for an author who has ‘previously written bestselling fiction under other names’.Note: My thanks to Hachette Australia and NetGalley for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.388820"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.388820"]]

My thanks to the author and his/her publisher.Has anyone else noticed that there are a slew of books in the past few years that have included the “Girl…” in their titles? The 'Girl' In The Title: More Than A Marketing TrendHere's a trend in new books: Publishers commonly promote them by comparing them to other books — and when the books are crime fiction or thrillers, and written by women, they get compared to the same books again and again and again.

Of course, there were a few things I didn’t like so much:•\\tFirstly, there were several 2 page chapters. There needed to be more space and development between alternating points of view. I am not an idiot; I can remember similar occurrences that happened between the two girls and Edward without it having to be repeated hard on the heels of each other.•\\tI would have liked the relationship between Emma and her psychiatrist to have been developed a bit more.

Especially if they're lackluster (though I do admit that I wasn't all that impressed with Gone Girl and it's my least favorite Flynn novel). This is my fault, really. I hate that mystery books are all compared to GG and GOTT, but I still pick them up, even though I've been burned time and time again. Unfortunately for me, The Girl Before was yet another burn.The Girl Before tries to be this edgy, steamy thriller that has shades of GG and 50 Shades of Grey. The thing is that it fails in every conceivable way. Mind you, I haven't read 50 Shades of Grey (and will never, ever read it due to how it seems to fetishize controlling behavior), but The Girl Before seems to have tried to captivate the same kind of steaminess (or rather try to captivate the people who considered FSOG steamy and not just icky w/ it's control factor). But it's not steamy, it's icky. And it's not edgy, it's just the same predictable mess that's come from all of the other GG wannabes.My main issue with The Girl Before is that the women are stupid. The main characters fall under the \"stupid characters do stupid, stupid things\" category. The Emma chapters were just a mess. Pretty much the author trying to throw everything, but the kitchen sink in there. They were so implausible (and that whole \"Daddy\" thing? Icky as fuck). And what was with writing the Emma chapters without quotation marks? Was it to differentiate the Emma chapters from the Jane chapters? Well, it worked. Cause I differentiated them by thinking, \"Oh, here are the Jane chapters and here are the pretentious, special snowflake without quotation marks chapters.\" It was so annoying and so unnecessary.Jane was no better. If Emma was pathetic, Jane was ten times worse. She gets all this evidence that Edward might not be a good dude and she constantly ignores it. She doesn't want to take anything those people tell her at face value, but has no problem taking what Edward tells her at face value. In fact, she's so pathetic that she wonders why all these guys are obsessed with Emma, while simultaneously lamenting that no one is obsessed with her. Really? You're upset because no one seems to be stalking you? Go home, Jane. You're drunk. So what does The Girl Before have going for it? It's a page-turner. That's it. Besides that, it's a mess. It's predictable, the least unique book you'll ever read, and full of unlikable characters who deserve to get hit by trains.

When I’d put down the book and pick it up a few hours later, I couldn’t remember which event/thing happened to which girl, because the story-lines were too similar. The whole book was too disjointed, simply because the two P.O.V. were too much alike.And what really bothered me about Emma’s chapters were the absence of quotation marks. I completely loath when writers feel the need to do this. Half the time, you can’t even tell who’s talking in Emma’s chapters, because, like I stated, there are no quotation marks. It was a big guessing game: Are these Emma’s thoughts, or is she speaking out loud? It’s such a headache to read a story with dialogue that breaks one of the most important rules of grammar. The lack of “” was distracting to the story and very off putting. \\tThe writing itself was sort of dry. A lot of “says…insert adverb here (drily, tartly, etc)” \\tI also found bits of this story to be too far-fetched. I don’t care how fancy or nice a house like One Folgate Street is, no one in their right mind would live in a place with so many rules and restrictions. I mean, no furniture? No books? Although, as much as I’d like to say the technology inside the house was teetering on the edge of science fiction, it really wasn’t. I can see variations of smart houses like One Folgate Street popping up in the future. \\tThis book did have its creepy moments, but it wasn’t exactly thriller or hair raising if you know what I mean. Yes, the house was eerie, but it wasn’t scary. \\tOn a good note, there were a couple twists and turns within the story that surprised me, and this really is a book you don’t want to put down. And, I did get The Girl on the Train vibe towards the second half of the novel which is always a good thing. \\tThank you to NetGalley/the publisher for this ARC. This is my honest, unbiased review!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.399447"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.399447"]]

I love books that have a resolved ending that leaves me feeling satisfied about the outcome. :DThe Girl Before follows the story of Emma (in the past) and Jane (in the present). It's a story about a house (One Folgate Street) that is a perfect home for people who want a nice house but can't afford an expensive one. But why is it so cheap? The one condition to purchasing this home is that you have to agree follow The Rules and be accepted after a strict application process, which most people don't pass.Emma is looking for a new start after her and her boyfriend's apartment was violently broken into while she was home alone. A little further in the future, Jane suffers the death of her perfect baby girl and wants to start over in a new home that doesn't remind her of the baby. Neither one of them can afford an expensive home, and they both are amazed by the simplicity and minimalist style of One Folgate Street. To apply for the house, the women fill out a long questionnaire with seemingly odd and sometimes personal questions and send photos of themselves along with it. Both of them send in their applications and receive an interview with Edward Monkford, the architect of the home. Monkford is gorgeous but controlling, and both women are drawn to him.Soon after she moves in, Jane finds out that the woman who lived in the house before her (Emma) had died under strange circumstances. She also finds out that she bears a striking resemblance to Emma - and to Monkford's late wife. Jane becomes obsessed with Emma's story and finding out what happened to her. I don't want to ruin anything so I'll stop there!The writing was very well thought-out and I really liked the way that it was told. The alternating chapters of Emma's POV (in the past) and Jane's POV (in the present) fit together really well. I thought that it was full of suspense and the ending was definitely not expected. Also, readers will never guess who \"the girl before\" is. I thought I had it figured out early on but I was wrong. The whole book was brilliant, in my opinion.Copy provided by Netgalley for a review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.404909"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.404909"]]

Yes it did - I raced through it in two days.One Folgate Street in London, England, is a architectural wonder. It is minimalism to the extreme. Stone, glass, white on white, no doors. And much is controlled by the Housekeeper - a computer program that takes its cues from the bracelet that the inhabitants wear.And who lives there? Only those chosen by the architect - after undergoing a rigorous application. And acceptance of the many rules of the house - no mess everything must be out of sight, no photos, no colour and much more.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"After a break-in, Emma see living in the house as safe, a sanctuary against danger. After her divorce, Jane sees the house as a clean slate, a new start. Emma lived at Folgate before Jane.The Girl Before is told in alternating chapters from Jane and Emma - now and then. When Jane learns of the previous tenant's death, she becomes consumed with finding out more - even though she is discouraged by the enigmatic Edward, the architect/owner. The reader is privy to the events during Emma's time in the house. And knowing what we know, the tension ratchets up as Jane seems to be following in her footsteps - and into danger......I felt like I should be on Emma and Jane's 'side', if you will. But as the book progressed and more of their personalities and their (questionable) choices are revealed, I found I didn't overly like either of them. But I still desperately wanted to know what next. Edward - well, he's in his own category. And I'm not too sure why either of them find him so appealing, but hey, this book wouldn't be the same without him being this way. Control, it's all about control with this guy. In his life and in his house. Super creepy.Gentle readers be warned - there are a few somewhat graphic sex scenes.Just get yourself past accepting that anyone would actually move into a house such as this with crazy rules and you are in for a deliriously addictive, psychologically twisty turny read with a nice little gotcha in the end."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.423733"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.423733"]]

Can architecture make social and personal interventions? These questions get raised but are ultimately subsumed beneath a pretty standard 'psychological' thriller: characters are damaged, pathological liars, psychopaths hidden in plain sight, and obsessive-compulsives with a bit of sexual exhibitionism thrown in for good measure and a couple of murders.The writing is smoother than is often the case in this kind of commercial fiction: the sections are very short, sometimes only half a page, at most a couple of pages, switching between Emma 'then' and Jane 'now'. There's lots of misdirection going on but personally I feel it's cheating to have twists that depend on 1st person narrators simply lying to us...So an enjoyable piece of fluff that I whizzed through in one sitting: I'd like to see Delaney do something more intelligent with the intriguing ideas that get suggested here but which ultimately have little to do with the plot.

This is a pseudonym for an author who has already published fiction under another name and you could tell that this wasn’t their first rodeo so to speak.The Girl Before is a psychological thriller that will have you guessing from the get go as the present and the past go on an eerily similar journey. This story is told in two point of views, Emma (The Girl Before) and Jane the present. Emma took up residency at One Folgate Street after an aggravated burglary left her with a crippling fear of living in her old house. The new house had to be high security to give her that “safe” feeling and One Folgate Street was the only property that fitted the bill. One Folgate Street was the brainchild of top architect, Edward Monkford and was as high spec as they came and extremely minimalist. Only tenants willing to go through an intense veto process and adhere to some two hundred rules could live there and that meant giving up everything that you didn’t need, living with the bare necessities and living clean and tidy. The house had a brain as it were and monitored the residents, adapting to their day to day routines, their preferences and their dislikes. It was a social experiment of sorts and one that the residents knew they were a part of, hence the affordable rent for an otherwise unobtainable property. \n  \n    “You can make your surroundings as polished and empty as you like. But it doesn’t really matter if you’re still messed up inside.”\n  \nJane is the current resident of One Folgate Street and is currently coming to terms with losing a child and One Folgate Street is her clean break and fresh start. Jane fell in love with the property and is immediately taken by its creator but it is not long before the walls begin to bleed their secrets. Once Jane becomes aware of the tragic past of the property she takes it upon herself to investigate…with startling revelations. Will the present mimic the past? \n  \n    “There was a time when One Folgate Street seemed like a calm, serene haven. Now it doesn’t. It feels claustrophobic and aggressive. Like the house is angry with me.”\n  \nI will say that because Emma and Jane’s stories were so startling similar at times, it did become hard to keep track of whose point of view I was currently reading. I found myself flipping back to the beginning of chapters when the characters began to blur. I did notice that Emma’s point of view did not contain any speech marks, if this was a way of differentiating between the two it didn’t work for me, it only made reading those chapters a tad confusing. It may be that there was a different method behind this style of writing but it wasn’t immediately apparent.\n  \n    “Never apologize for someone you love, he says quietly. It makes you look like a prick.”\n  \nThis was an addictive read though, one that I couldn’t put down. JP Delaney cleverly built this story, slowly peeling back his characters like the layers of an onion. As each layer is removed the character’s secrets became fewer, the truth more apparent and I was anxiously waiting to reach the centre. With each chapter, the more engrossed I became and while the beginning is a little slow to get going, it soon becomes apparent that the pacing was deliberate in its lure to totally submerse you in Emma and Jane’s story. This was a clever manipulation of the mind as your brain screams at you to believe one thing, yet your subconscious tells you another. Do you rule with your heart, head or your gut instinct?I did have a few issues with The Girl Before, hence the rating, but as psychological thrillers went this certainly held my attention from the start and left me with that constant fear of woe throughout. I did feel that the ending was rushed and did not feel any particular closure with Edward and Jane and while I could see where the author wanted to go at the end, its delivery let it down. While this book does stretch your imagination at times, I am sure that someone, somewhere has already invented a house like this, whether I would want to be a part of it…hell no and I did find myself struggling to come to terms with the residents willing participation. Sometimes though the allure of grandeur knocks all common sense from people and picking on an already vulnerable person was probably the kick starter to garner anyone’s interest. However, it was gripping, it had my mind running a mile a minute, even taking notes as I tried to decipher fact from fiction, truth from lies and throw those red herrings overboard. I am usually wrong, I would be a crap detective but I did get this one right.\n  \n    “I built something as simple as a mausoleum because that was how I felt at the time. But then I realised that in my madness I’d inadvertently created something extraordinary. A house that would demand a sacrifice from anyone who lived there, but which would repay that sacrifice a thousand-fold. There are some it destroys… But some it makes stronger.”\n  \nThis is soon to become a film, I can see the allure and personally cannot wait to see how this is depicted on the big screen.www.theromancecover.com"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.444385"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.444385"]]

But in this case, there were moments where I genuinely felt like I was reading a  Gone Girl rip-off. There were other moments that felt like a carbon copy of  The Girl on the Train. And, because apparently we needed to make matters even worse, this book also felt like it had healthy dashes of  Fifty Shades of Grey thrown in there. Cue me throwing up.What is this book about? Two women, separated by a couple years, going through the same process of moving into a new home and starting affairs with the architect who built it. His house comes with hundreds of rules to ensure that every detail of the tenant's life is like something out of a wet dream of Marie Kondo. His relationships come with just as many regulations. I think the point where I wanted to throw the book across the room in disgust was when this man told one of his lovers that she should groom her pubic hair because it wasn't perfectly symmetrical....but there were a million things just like this. He was possibly the most vomit-inducing love interest I have ever read about. Having to witness not one but TWO women fall for this guy was torturous. The two timelines have so many similarities IT IS LIKE READING THE EXACT SAME BOOK TWICE. WHY.The ~mystery~ aspect was lacking. I felt like J.P Delaney was trying desperately hard to cram in as many shocking moments as possible but it wasn't done in any sort of original way so I could predict everything because it was all so overdone. And this is coming from someone who rarely reads thrillers. I felt like so many of the reveals just involved a character turning out to be some sort of general \"crazy person.\" This is not only boring but also just offensive. Some of the most intense moments of the book were actually cartoonishly ridiculous to me. There's a plotline about rape that I found EXTREMELY disappointing and absolutely unforgivable. If this is something you're sensitive about, I recommend skipping this book completely but I'll add a spoiler about this in case you need it: (view spoiler)[Basically, it's very triggering and graphic and then it turns out that the rape allegations were completely false. The protagonist actually accuses two separate men of raping her and then two OTHER men of abusing her. The abuse is pretty minor compared to the rape in terms of attention in the plot. But yeah. It's all absolutely shitty. I have very low tolerance for false rape allegations in fiction.

The mutual setting is an unusual apartment - one that is a living model of high architecture - designed by an enigmatic architect. Emma and Jane narrate two different narratives that bring them to live at this unusual residence at separate times. While different circumstances brought them to their new home, their lives share similarities - particularly as they abide by the stringent rules set by the architect - and later by their relationship with the architect himself. Both women, too, are haunted by the titular girl before - in Emma's case, she becomes obsessed with the first wife of the architect, while Jane becomes obsessed with Emma.The chapters alternate between the two women and the similarities (and later, the differences) really amplifies the tension. As echoes of the two women's lives ring out across the whole, it really makes this an absorbing read. The plot moves along at a fast pace and does involve more surprises to the plot than I expected. At first, the book really feels like a straightforward read and each woman's actions and investigations adds complexity to the plot and their characters. Jane's section in particular has a tragic backstory, that may be a bit too sad for some readers. But, overall, it is an exciting and engaging read. The conclusion fits nicely, too.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jan 26, 2017"], ["review_text", "When choosing a book to read I often follow my gut feeling, especially when it comes to the authors that I don't know - although JP Delaney is a pen name for a best - selling author, and when reading \"The Girl Before\" I was looking for any hallmarks but I didn't guess the real name - and when spotting this book I just had a feeling that this could be THE read. And well, yes, it turned out that I should trust my gut feeling as the book was totally engrossing and kept me glued to the pages. \"The Girl Before\" was a provocative, incredibly smart story about controlling and manipulations, making reader to ask who is reliable there and whom shall we trust.Now. \"The Girl Before\". We can start debating who the hell would go and live voluntarily in a house with 200 stipulations including no pets (no way), no children, no cushions, no curtains, no personal things on the floor, no books (hello?). And yet they signed on the dotted line. The house itself is an example of minimalism and the latest and best home technology, adjusting itself to the weather, temperature and probably the mood of the inhabitants. Originally designed by Edward Monkton as his family home but there was an accident on the site when his wife and his young son died. Also, he is the one who, after interviewing the prospective renters, is to decide if they're going to live there or not. Weird, no? Who in their right mind would go for something like this? I wouldn't, and I don't want to go into this debate, but I thought that it is a brilliant and unique idea and premise for a book. For me the book sounded unique, not like others books that I read, and the only thing that didn't work so good for me was the end, that sounded too Disney-like and somehow didn't sit with the book. However, this is probably the only thing that I'm going to criticise. There were maybe some things that made me feel uncomfortable, just like building the house on the grave or some scenes with abuse - both human and animal - but nothing that would make me cringe.The story alternates between Emma (Then) and Jane (Now), and the chapters were short and dynamic and it also made the story flow and reading much quicker. It was also the writing that makes this book so outstanding. It is sparse, but it is incredibly hooking and just beautiful - we can say just like the house! It just feels like the house, to be honest, white and with no barriers or unnecessary things and beautiful in its frugality. The way the stories of Emma and Jane mirrored made me feel a little claustrophobic and insecure, to be honest, it brought a lot of tension and changed my perspective more than once.I loved how the story was divided between the two points of view. Both of them were in the first person but I've never had a problem to see who's speaking. Duh, the chapters did have titles with the name of the characters! I also liked the way both stories were interwoven and how quickly and effortlessly they picked up when the other has just finished. Really, as the chapters flip back and forth the similarities between the women and their lives started to feel suspicious and somehow creepy, and it was obvious that eventually I'll start to suspect Edward as well.I think the characters there are not created to be liked by the readers. Their decisions didn't help to warm to them, and it is not that I had problems with the characters but I did think that both the women, Emma and Jane, were incredibly naive. There were thousands of warning bells that they chose to ignore and the way they meekly agreed to be controlled by both house and Edward was remarkable and odd. I mean, allowing a man to control your diet and exercise? No, thank you. It was even more surprising that they were like lambs because they were both relatively troubled women and they should know better.The house on One Folgate was like a living and breathing character itself, to be honest. I really started to believe that the house is trying to destroy the ones it doesn't approve of, that it controls the lives. It was truly extraordinary how the author managed to create this special, claustrophobic atmosphere of this place.It is not a book that is destined to make you scared or look over your shoulder. It is a book that is destined to make you feel tension and suspense, keep you in the dark and play with your mind. It is a slow burner, this novel, but with this kind of book it shouldn't be different - well, you can't expect the biggest twist to be explained on the first pages, right. No, you're expecting it to grow slowly in tension, to change tracks, to pull wool over your eyes, and \"The Girl Before\" just does it. However, as the circle of suspects was very limited in the novel, the end didn't come as such a BIG surprise, although the last quarter of the story truly meddled with my mind and made me change my opinion about some characters.Because of the slow pace it takes some time for the book to really pick up, and it happens when Jane discovers that someone died in the house before, and it also takes time for Emma to start to feel afraid. However, even with it taking time, for me it was engaging, interesting and unusual read. The way the story developed was very masterfully and skilfully plotted and organized and I absolutely admired this feeling of dread that the author smuggled onto the pages.This is a story about secrets, lies and appearances that can often be deceiving. It is one huge rollercoaster ride full of ups and downs and there was something very special in it and I didn't want to put it down. It is an engrossing mystery, even if the characters are not too likeable - but they don't have to be in this kind of story. It is good enough that they are multi - layered, they are very complex and I think that no matter what, we never know if they're telling the truth or if they're hiding something. It was a thought - provoking, addictive and a clever read, multi - layered with many surprises and I highly recommend \"The Girl Before\" to you.Copy provided by the publisher in return for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.476720"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:11:17.476720"]]

But I almost think it does a disservice to the book they're trying to get me to read. So I almost avoided this. Alas, the actual description here on Netgalley was so riveting I requested it, and I'm thrilled that I did (no pun intended)! I want to read a book because YOU think it's great, not because it's just like someone else's book (I didn't even like The Girl On The Train. Rachel was far too pathetic for my taste.)Now THIS... this was an innovative spin on those other psychological novels. The house itself became a character. I actually wish that was explored more. I loved the way all of the characters developed here. (view spoiler)[ There were a couple of 'wait what?!\" moments that threw me off that I fully intended on writing here like 'why would she uh, slob his knob when the burglars forced her to do that exact thing to them? Why not just have sex. But you know... that was taken care of.My huge qualm was that the ending felt like the author was like 'Welp, why don't we just go ahead and make everyone a psycho. Even though house. He's a psycho! She's a psycho! Everyonesssss a psycho!!!! It felt a bit cop out. Also, Edward was much too precise through the book for him to just be like 'let's get rid of that and make a new one of our own' about the baby. The way it was written he sounded like a child having a tantrum and it was disappointing to see his character make that jump.Then when she said she had a surprise of her own... that she had planned the baby. No. What? No! (that was me when i read that) I thought she was going to say the baby didn't have downs and she was just testing him. If it was part of her plan it should have been something the reader was aware of. There were enough surprises at the end that it would have served us readers better. WE would have wanted to believe Edward was good when she was trying to find out who killed Emma. We would have been championing him WITH her and even MORE torn about him being the possible killer.That being said, it was still a great and riveting book. And the ending happened so quickly that I can forget it and just act like it ended my way. LOL!

When you’re comparing a novel to those, you have big shoes to fill, and anything less feels like a disappointment.The only similarities between these novels are the overall tone and the twist, but in The Girl Before, it’s a predictable twist.

I'm also excited to learn there will be a movie adaptation coming out, directed by Ron Howard, which is impressive in its own right especially considering the book won't be officially released until next month so apparently someone has faith in its success and I don't disagree. The Girl Before was a fast-paced, psychological, thriller that alternates point of view and narration between Jane Cavendish, in present tense, and Emma Matthews, a previous resident of the house Jane is now renting who died tragically at the residence under suspicious circumstances. Both women find common ground at One Folegate Street, an architectural wonder, designed, owned and dictated by Edward Monkford but aside from that and their striking physical resemblance the two women have little in common. Emma is deceitful and manipulative and dishonest to the core, where Jane is good hearted and well meaning, trying to recover from a recent still birth and uncover the history of the home she now lives in and the mysterious deaths of several of its former inhabitants. The home itself comes with many rules and regulations that the renter must agree to and follow under strict supervision of Edward Monkford. In a way this reminds me loosely of Fifty Shades of Grey even though I didn't like the Fifty Shades Trilogy at all and I thorough enjoyed The Girl Before, however there were definitely similarities. The dynamic between Edward and the women in his life for one, his narcissistic personality, his obsessive compulsive tendencies and need for absolute control, to name a few. I really liked the contrast between Jane and Emma. J.P. Delaney did a great job creating realistic, three dimensional characters and I found it was easy to become invested in them because they were so real, despite their character flaws. This was an ending that I didn't see coming, in more than one way actually, and that's something that I considered absolutely necessary in a good thriller. I will say that I found myself a bit disappointed at the very end. (view spoiler)[**spoiler alert** I don't want to say too much but I personally wasn't pleased with the choice Jane made at the very end. Perhaps it was the noble thing to do, however, if Edward had given me the same choice if I were in Jane's shoes I am quite confident I would have gone in the opposite direction then Jane went and I was hoping she'd do the same. I don't want to give to much away so I'll leave it at that.I read a lot of books from this genre and I can honestly say this one can hold its own amongst the vast competition out there and I'd definitely recommend it and look forward to seeing the movie version when it comes out.

Are you good enough for the house? What sacrifices can you make if you want to live here?

No things on the floor, no pictures on the wall, no pets, no kids, no curtains, no rugs, and much more. The house should always be open to tours and architects, and you will be required to submit to impromptu questions about yourself or certain parts of the electrical system will shut down.

Emma seems similar to Jane, which sends Jane on a mission to find out what happened. he mysterious death is just the beginning.This was a really quick read for me. I found myself really liking both Emma and Jane. There were pretty similar sounding at first, but as the story went on things changed. Neither of these girls is really likeable, although I did feel really sorry for Jane. The love interest for both of these women was horrible.

He would have had to be more than just good-looking to be worth all the trouble.The house has some really cool features and I loved learning about them all. An app on your phone can control the house, which is nothing really new. This house also learns from you and will remember things like what temperature you like the water in the shower to be. This house, through the app, can also tell you if you need to pick up more milk or eggs, since it can sense what is in your fridge. While all that sounds cool, I was left thinking about what a violation of privacy not having curtains, and almost certainly having cameras in the house would be.The twists were okay for me. The pacing of this story was excellent until about 60% where the characters started to show their true colors and the story started to unravel for me. It didn’t go anywhere near where I expected it. I hated almost everyone by the end of the story and felt certain the house was indeed cursed.In brighter news, I heard this was to be made into a movie directed by Ron Howard.

The character from the past is Emma. From the present, we have Jane. They have a lot in common, and it starts with them renting a house. The house is very unique. It is austere, and there is a very long list of rules that you must agree to in order to live there.Both of the girls end up in a relationship with the architect, Edward. As we weave through both of their stories, we see that their relationships are very much the same, following the same patterns as Edward asserts his dominance.Emma has a violent past. She was attacked in her old apartment where she lived with her boyfriend, Simon. They move into the new house to help Emma get over it. She and Simon soon break up.Jane's past involves a still-born daughter. She is also trying to heal. Jane finds out that Emma died in this house, and becomes somewhat obsessed with finding out how.They both find out that Edward's wife and daughter were killed while the house was being built and are forever interred in the foundation.The Girl Before is a weird story. This house is very high-tech. And between that and the rules, it seems to change the personalities of the people who live there. It's hard to explain without your reading it, and I don't want to spoil too much.Ultimately, it's a mystery about just what happened to Emma, as well as Edward's family. But the journey to these answers is very entertaining.I found the lack of quotation marks annoying. And even more annoying is at some points Delaney uses them, and then other times not. It had to do with which character was talking, but it was hard for me to adjust back and forth. I didn't see a need for this technique. In other books like this, I eventually got used to it, but with The Girl Before, it kept switching back and forth.While I was suitably surprised by the outcome, I still felt the ending needed some more punch. I was expecting a weird, exciting twist, and I just didn't get it. I would still recommend The Girl Before. I found it easy to read and very engaging. I'm not sure I would recommend this to most teens because of the sexual situations; it's definitely an adult book.Added note: the Amazon entry for this book says it's soon to be a motion picture directed by Ron Howard.

The story is told from each woman's point of view, with Emma's story being 'Then', and Jane's story being 'Now'. Emma and Jane both end up choosing to live in the same house, located at One Folgate Street. They had to jump through some unusual hoops in order to live there, however.Prior to being approved, anyone interested in living in the starkly minimalist house is required to fill out a form with some rather odd questions, and agree to live by a set of 200 rules, which includes having no books, photos, throw pillows, or anything else that is considered 'clutter' in the house. They must also include a photo of themselves, something each woman thought odd.The architect and owner of the house is a man named Edward, who originally built the house for his family. After losing his wife and son, Edward never lived there, choosing instead to rent it out for an extremely low price to anyone who was willing to live by his stringent demands.Both women become involved with Edward, and when Jane finds out that Emma—whom she closely resembles—died in the house, she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her. Was it truly an accident, or something more sinister that killed Emma? Was Edward involved? Despite being warned against it, Jane is relentless in her search for the truth, never realizing she was putting herself in danger... until it was too late.The Girl Before is a deliciously creepy psychological thriller worthy of the genre. I devoured it in a single day... I just couldn't put it down until I knew who did what, and why. There were several surprises along the way, but the last one left me so stunned, you could have knocked me over with a feather. I'm not kidding. My jaw hit the floor and I kept shaking my head in disbelief because (and I know I say this a lot) I NEVER saw it coming.Treat yourself and get a copy of this book when it hits the shelves.

(Yeah I know its a bit of a cliché) But it was true.The book is divided into two stories that ultimately involve the same house 1, Folgate Street. It tells the story of Emma who was a previous tenant and her chapters are titled Then : Emma and the current tenant Jane and her chapters are titled Now : Jane. Both their stories revolve around an enigmatic architect called Edward Monkford who has somewhat of a tragic history.Edward Monkford designed 1, Folgate Street which is the cutting edge in minimalistic living and unobtrusive technology. He has a lot of rules (at least 200) for whatever successful applicant he lets out his house to. Some of the ideas for the house are actually quite amazing but how long before an occupant would start to feel the sterile walls start to close in around them? This part of the point of the story, to have next to no personal possessions apart from the absolute essential and have the house with its own computerised system called Housekeeper. (Which is monitored by Edward) Nothing is private.Emma and Jane are two very different people who have both been through trauma and although their stories are told in the present and the past they feel like they are running together. There are divides between their chapters that ask questions with multiple choice or agree/disagree that are subjected to the tenants but can also make you think what would you do?There is a mystery surrounding what happened to Emma that Jane is determined to get to the bottom of as well as trying to find out what makes Edward tick as they start a relationship of sorts. There is much manipulation going on within the pages from most of the people in book so at times it is hard to feel sympathy for everyone as more and more is revealed. There are dark deeds at work and not everything is as it seems, which is good to have at the heart of a mysterious thriller, after all!

You have two parallel stories, both from the point of view of a different young woman. One has lost a baby at full term in a terrible birth story that I found very moving, the other has been badly mentally damaged by being the victim of a home invasion. They both at different times live in a house which is austere, minimalistic and which demands a great deal of sacrifice by those who live there. You must pass a complicated test, take regular re-testing and allow architecture students access to the house. There is a mystery surrounding the house, rumours that there was a terrible accident involving the architect's wife and that she died on the premises. The architect is an enigma, compellingly attractive but also complicated and apparently very available! The house has secrets, the architect has secrets, everyone is unreliable, nobody can be trusted.If you analysed this from a feminist perspective this is a book about abuse in lots of forms, it is a book full of characters who should have known better, who behave badly and who are a bit pathetic. I had annoyances in how the author portrayed the women, I looked up to see if this was written by a man or a woman, turns out this is a pseudonym for a man, colour me unsurprised! No woman would have written these women this way. But when you are reading it and you suspend your disbelief and cynical eye, it is a really good read. It is pacy and compelling.

The chapters alternate between Emma and Jane, past and present. Each of these young women are willing \"audition\" to rent a clinically beautiful and technologically advanced house by a famous minimalist architect. First comes a long questionnaire of odd and personal questions. Each young woman fills out the questionnaire which also requires three photos. Hmmmm. The weird questions and the photo requirement didn't set off any warning bells? If Edward Monkhouse, the architect and owner, likes the responses, then he grants an interview to decide who is appropriate for the house. Of course, both Emma and Jane get an interview. There are rules--lots of them: no books, no rugs, no personal effects, no photos, no clutter. A computer \"housekeeper\" monitors everything in the house. Both Emma and Jane are unreliable narrators and willing to surrender their personalities to fit the house and the architect. I have a thing about people who give up everything to satisfy another person or ideological belief. I know it happens, but it is almost impossible for me to imagine. It is one thing for it to happen gradually as in a Stockholm Syndrome situation or a domestic situation that develops over time as a matter of gradual reconditioning, but for an eager almost immediate surrender to someone else's dictates?

Delaney. Though lured by a strong synopsis that promised a solid mystery, I knew I was in trouble with this book early on, simply because I didn’t buy the main premise of the story. Even bearing in mind the crazy cost of London rentals, I just don’t believe that anyone would want to live at cut-price One Folgate Street, no matter how futuristically ground-breaking its design might be. Why? Because to live here pretty much means signing your whole life, including all of your possessions, away. It also means signing a contract that contains more than two-hundred clauses (I’m not exaggerating), thanks to a landlord who is, to put it mildly, a complete control freak.The landlord in question is Edward Monkford, the renowned architect who designed One Folgate Street, and now rents it out to a very select few tenants. Jane is one of these tenants, as was Emma, the ‘girl before’ of the title. The Girl Before employs a dual timeline, and it soon becomes clear that both Jane and Emma’s time at One Folgate Street follows eerily similar patterns, including the fact that both women inexplicably start to fall for the utterly charmless Monkford. The catch? Monkford has a dark side. He also has a past. The other catch? Emma didn’t leave One Folgate Street alive – she left in a body bag. Will Jane escape the clutches of One Folgate Street before it’s too late? Will she say ‘screw it’ to all those clauses in her contract, and run? She really should.An instant bestseller with a movie in the works, The Girl Before was also recently named ‘Thriller of the Month’ by The Sunday Times.

Although, I have never heard of the author J.P. Delaney this book is going to be the most talked about book in 2017 when it hits the shelves and stores around the world. This story is told from alternate POVs which I've absolutely come to love in books. We are being told a story from \"Before Emma\", a previous occupant in yet a very unconventional but architecural marvel, who once suffered from a home break in and has come to this home for safety. Next we have \"Now Jane\", the current occupant, who was lead her to forget her past and her personal tragedy. Both are trying to escape their past, while seeing their journey parallel to one another and both fall and begin relationship with the owner of this crazy amazing home. Which by the way the home itself could be another fascinating character in the story. Well that's a glimpse of what's to come if you read this book. You'll be guessing until the end.

The idea, he claims, is that people can be changed by this state-of-the art dwelling and minimalist living style. The narration alternates between Emma (THEN) and Jane (NOW). Each has her own personality and both have recently experienced an event that has left them vulnerable and weakened. Now they become obsessed by the house, the architect, and those that lived there before -- especially when it seems that death has visited. The characters have a lot of depth and the chapters are short so the book moves very fast. Manipulation, deception, and suspicion lead to only one end.Ignore the fact that these books of psycho drama featuring women are now always compared to those titles I will not name, but you know what I mean. There is a lot of hype about this novel, and it is definitely one all fans of this genre should read. The author is writing under a pseudonym and you can tell it's not a debut work.Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine for the e-book ARC to review.

There should be suspense but for me the flip flopping each paragraph between women made it hard for me to connect with either of them. I think I would've liked a bit more time on each character before swapping over in paragraphsI also found the minimalist rules hard to swallow. Conditions of being able to rent mean these women have to give up all their possessions and follow a series of rules set out by the creepy architect of the house who may or may not have killed his wife and buried her under the patio. I understand the need for a fresh start but how about a bit of de-cluttering instead??The language is sparse, designed to suit the house and minimalist ideas giving you a quick read. I do actually like the design of the house as I could picture it with everything having it's place but I'm not signing a lease that bars me from cushions to keep the aesthetic.

A pacy read, it alternates between the viewpoints of two women, one before and one after. The plot centres around a house that first Emma and subsequently Jane have signed up to live in, despite a hefty set of unusual rules, and an owner who may not be quite what he seems. It kept me interested and was a quick, easy read, with some good shock moments peppered throughout, and the obligatory 'twist' at the end. Overall, however, it wasn't outstanding. I didn't really care for either of the main characters, or anyone else in the book for that matter, but then in all of the thrillers I have read in this vein, that has been the case. It is a light, entertaining read probably suited to fans of the other big players in this sub-genre (Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train etc. etc.) but aside from one or two well written creepy moments, it won't be one you can't stop thinking about. I do feel it could have been elevated to provide a higher shock factor if Jane had made a different decision towards the end of the book, and indeed this lack of decision is the only element that has stayed with me after finishing reading. I hear it has been picked up for a film version, and it reads like it was written with just that intention.

I'm not sure about the comparisons to Gone Girl, because this book doesn't have time for the intense character development of that book, because it has more characters, one being a very cool, and yet disturbing house.  This book goes back and forth in time, alternating between two women who both rent a cutting edge 'smart house' from a mysterious architect who interviews new residents and gives them a set of rules.  These rules are not just the 'no pets-no-kids' type rules--more like a 'lifestyle' set of rules with questionnaires popping up periodically that cause the 'smart house' to shut down all amenities until the questions are answered.  A bit over-bearing, just like the landlord, a handsome, mysterious award winning architect who believes that our living spaces should change and define us.  Now you get a sense of the weirdness of the house, and it's builder so it's on to two very damaged women who live in the house at different times. One, who's had her previous apartment burglarized, and the other woman who's had a stillborn child's.  The plot moves back and forth between the two women as we learned what really happened. Since this is a thriller, I don't want to give anything away.  Just have fun reading and trying to guess 'who done it'.

Slabs of pale stone, expansive plate glass, soaring ceilings, tile floors, a stairway with no railing.  An app controls lighting, shower pressure and internet access. There already have been three deaths at the site.  Maybe another one soon?Edward Monkford, the owner and architect, rents the austere structure at a bargain price, but there are stipulations.  No clutter of any sort.  Compliance is monitored by sensors and cameras.  An applicant is interviewed by the sleek owner and fills out a long questionnaire, which begins: “Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.”The story is told in alternating chapters by Jane, the new tenant, and Emma, “the girl before.”  They look alike.  Both are recovering from traumas.  Both become involved with Edward.  Jane learns that Emma died in a fall from the unguarded stairs and that Edward’s wife and young son were killed in an accident during construction at the site.  According to Emma’s therapist, Jane is in danger.  From Edward?  Will Jane become the next  girl before?”  We find out at the violent climax.I hesitated to pick up another book with “girl” in the title, having read “Gone Girl,” “The Girl on the Train” and others.  But I’m glad I did.  This “girl” book is as meticulously constructed as the sleek house.An afterward tells the reader that JP (no period after either initial) Delaney is the pseudonym of a bestselling writer.  A movie version of the book is to be directed by Ron Howard.

You can't have anything on the floors or counters for example.I couldn't quite understand why either of these women wanted that house so badly.  They have to complete a lengthy questionnaire on their values, submit to an interview, and provide three photos.  It is framed as a social experiment.And then every now and then the Housekeeping program sends more questions and until the occupant answers them, certain functions of the house are shut down.The story is cleverly told and for a while the reader can't tell if the  girl before  is Emma or Jane.  I don't usually like alternating chapter voices, but this is well done.As the story unfolds, the reader learns more about Emma and Jane.  Neither has been quite honest.I'm not usually able to guess who  did it  but I did in this case.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jan 20, 2017"], ["review_text", "\n  \"Yes, daddy. Yes.\"\nNo. Please no. I feel like somebody noted the success of books like Gone Girl and the success of Fifty Shades of Grey and thought: wouldn't it be great if we had a book that combined the two? No, actually. No, it wouldn't.The Girl Before failed on so many levels, and I say that as a reluctant fan of these \"domestic thrillers\". I've enjoyed everything from The Girl on the Train to last year's ridiculous but fast-paced Behind Closed Doors. I expected I'd like this one too, but all I got was a weird relationship with \"rules\", another guy called Edward, and transparent twists.The book alternates between the perspectives of Emma (Before) and Jane (After) as they move into the techno-minimalist apartment at One Folgate Street. Though beautiful, there is almost no furniture, absolutely everything is digital, and most bizarre of all - the landlord and famous architect, Edward Monkford, requires that his tenants follow some very strict rules. Both women soon find themselves caught up in a love affair with Edward, but when Jane discovers that Emma died in the apartment, she can't help investigating further.Jane's digging uncovers some disturbing facts about Emma - she expressed concern over Edward's controlling ways to her psychiatrist, her death may not have been an accident, and strangest of all, she looked eerily like Jane herself.Firstly, I don't know what is wrong with these women. Without giving away twists, their behaviour is often outright ridiculous. Warning bells are going off left, right and centre, and they're completely oblivious. At worst, Edward is a murderer, but even at best, he's a creepy weirdo. It's almost comical how much he resembles Christian Grey - not just sexually dominant and prone to \"losing control\" but also strict about Emma and Jane's eating and exercise habits. Ick. Get out. Also, lots of people have a \"type\", but it's just plain weird if your \"type\" are all women who look virtually identical. Secondly, there is no atmosphere. I feel like the author tried to create a \"creepy house with a dark history\" feeling, but it didn't come through because so much of the book was nothing more than a weird romance. I also see how Delaney was trying to create a \"ghost of past lovers\" vibe, but this ain't no Daphne du Maurier. The writing wasn't strong enough to make you scared for the characters, to keep you metaphorically looking over your shoulder.It is often really difficult to distinguish between the two perspectives. I had to keep flicking to the beginning of the chapter to find out whether I was on Emma or Jane. This is partly because the style is impersonal and doesn't deeply connect you with the characters, but also partly because their stories are very similar. As we soon see, Edward takes them to the same places, gives them the same food, treats them the same ways - it was like reading the same perspective twice.And there's a whole bunch of subtle racism going on, as well as a bunch of other distasteful issues. If you insist on only writing about white, middle class people, don’t make the criminals/rapists black and working class. How do you not see what's wrong with that? And casual comments like this (made by a psychiatrist): \"In any relationship there are two repetition compulsions at work - his and hers.\" I can think of a whole lot of relationships where that definitely isn't true.Plus, there's a really poor and insensitive use of rape as a plot device. Without giving away spoilers, someone who was seen to be orally raped is then making jokes about preferring human sperm sacs (to fish sperm sacs - it's a long story, Japanese restaurant, blah blah). Firstly... gross. And secondly... gross.But maybe, even after all of this, I could have been persuaded to up my rating if the ending had provided us with an interesting and satisfying reveal. Unfortunately, I saw it coming from a mile away. The list of suspects is too short; the list of suspects who we'd actually care about it being is even shorter. I'm sorry, but I can't even find anything good to say about it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.748067"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.748067"]]

Is this madness ever going to end? Why can’t a book be left to stand on it’s own merits? I guess it’s my fault for giving in and picking up yet another ‘Girl’ book. Have no fear though, once again, I’ve landed in the minority, as the reviews I’ve seen have been overwhelming positive and apparently it’s being made into a movie. So, take this review with a grain of salt. It’s just one reader’s thoughts and feelings, after all.Point blank - I don’t get it. This whole scenario is strange. Odd. Completely ridiculous. What sane person would agree to live in this situation? Forget sane - why would anybody sign up for this?Maybe I’m the crazy one, but there is no way I would ever agree to give up most of my belongings to move in to a minimalistic stone box of a house that comes with over 200 stipulations. Restrictive and ridiculous rules. Not to mention, answering a bizarre questionnaire and having my “amenities” shut down every time the perfectionistic control freak of a landlord feels like I need to answer yet another series of questions. All in an effort to gauge my “growth” or acceptance of the lifestyle the house demands. I don’t care how good looking or how famous of an architect the owner is; I wouldn’t do it. The author sells the idea by garnering sympathy from the reader for the two women and the excitement of top of the line technology - it's the ultimate smart house. Both women have recently experienced tragedies and need a fresh start. And, of course, the rent for this pseudo stone cell is quite cheap. Hmm . . . I wonder why?The story unfolds through the eyes of the two women - Emma, the previous tenant, and Jane, the current tenant. The story flip-flops between then and now, which takes place two years apart, at a pretty rapid pace. We get to see how their stories mirror each other and it’s a little convoluted at times. More than once, I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose head I was in because I was kind of lost. I liked the whole notion of getting caught up in a story or your past and recreating or reliving that same story over and over. But that’s were the likes kind of ended for me.The entire plot felt like a tangled mess and not one I particularly enjoyed unraveling. Albeit, there was something about it that kept me turning the pages. I can’t say I was wowed though - not by the characters, the scenario or even the twist. I failed to see what so many others have found exceptional about this one.*THANK YOU to Random House/Ballantine Books and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.751715"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.751715"]]

The movie rights have even been sold to Universal with Ron Howard to direct. I didn't know any of that when I first read the description for the book. I just thought it sounded like an entertaining read.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"One Folgate Street in London, is a high-tech minimalist house with so many cool amenities and features that you would figure the rent would be sky-high. But the rent is actually very reasonable.So what's the catch? Well there's no catch really...Except for THE RULES!!Tenants are required to follow very a list of very strict rules. Things like no pets, paying rent on time, no loud noise after 11pm, take out the garbage. You know, things like that...NOPE...not at all like that.There are over 200 rules that tenants MUST be abide by in order to live in the house.To say that the owner/landlord of One Folgate Street is picky about who lives in the house is an understatement. To say that he's a bit particular about his rules for the tenants is putting it mildly. The rental application is extremely long and includes many bizarre (and impossible) questions.\"A person close to you confesses in confidence that they ran someone over while drunk. As a result they have given up drinking for good. Would you feel obliged to report it to the police?\"Is it worth it to live in such a beautiful high-tech home? This home with its awesome hidden gadgets. A house cleaner comes weekly. The lights, heat and cooling will set to tenants personal preferences. The shower will also adjust to their personal settings. Even the air in the house makes you feel better with its ultrasonic - mood enhancing waveforms.\"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary.\"Just don't forget.....the RULES. The main one? NO CLUTTER! Everything has its place, usually out of sight. So no pictures, no plants, no ornaments, no books....wait NO BOOKS???? (OMG!!! that's just wrong!)The owner, Edward Monkford is the architect who built the house. He also lives a minimalist lifestyle. He will not rent unless he finds the perfect tenant. But his need for control goes so much farther than that. And yet... some people are drawn to the \"tormented genius\". But who is Edward really? What happens if someone does break the rules?Emma and her boyfriend, Simon are looking for a safe place to live after a recent break-in. However, their budget is a bit tight and everything is either horrible or too expensive. Then the agent shows them One Folgate Street. She explains the lengthy process for application. Simon is hesitant but Emma feels like the place might be exactly what they need. The rules make her feel secure. She wants to reinvent herself, bring order to her life, to change and be a better person.The house may change her, but will it be for the better?We then meet Jane. After a devastating loss, Jane is looking for new place to live. She wants to make a new start and hopes that One Folgate Street is the place to do it. But it's not long before some strange things start happening. Jane learns some of the dark history of the house and is determined to find out more, especially what happened to the previous tenant.The house may be inexpensive and full of high-tech gadgets, but the walls of the house are also full of secrets. Where is the previous tenant? and is Jane in any danger?\"That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\"This book may not be for everyone. There is a lot of sex. I will definitely say that some of the characters \"turn-ons\" may be \"turn-offs\" for some readers. It wasn't really my thing and I could have done without those parts. However, it didn't really interfere with my enjoyment of the rest of the book.The chapters alternate between THEN and NOW and are narrated by Jane (NOW) and Emma (THEN). I flew through the pages. Occasionally I had to flip back to double-check whether it was Emma or Jane but most of the time I was able to keep up. The story may have been hard to believe and far-fetched at times, but I decided to try to go with the flow and enjoy it...In the end I really liked this novel. I was pulled and it got right inside my head. I had to know what was going to happen! A thrilling story about a house I would NEVER want to live in, (seriously I could not handle any of the rules) but I sure enjoyed reading about it.P.S Put your shampoo awayThank you, Ballantine Books for providing an advanced copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.755195"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.755195"]]

It is an example of extreme minimalism and incorporates the latest home technology. It was originally designed by the techno-architect Edward Monkton as his family home but his wife and son died there which means its now available for others to live. Only there is the slight problem of over 200 conditions that have to be adhered to by whoever lives there. And they have to be interviewed and approved by Monkton personally. The narrative focuses on Emma from the past, and Jane in the present. Both are troubled women. Emma was held at knife point by burglars and she is struggling to come to terms with this. This event drives her decision to apply to live in the house, despite her boyfriend, Simon's reservations. The conditions for residing there will turn her into a new person with more control, Jane has had a stillborn baby and grieving. This house will be her new start and she just happens to fancy the architect. She is receiving a flower delivery of gentians which she assumes is from the architect until she reads the card....and realises there is more to the house than she thought. Emma died in the house.A concerned Jane begins to investigate Emma, the girl before to ascertain whether she was murdered, and if so by whom. There are uncomfortable similarities between her and Emma. From both resembling Edward's wife, to having a no strings attached affair with him which runs a similar if not identical course, to both having risque sex. Jane meets the people in Emma's life including Simon, the aggrieved boyfriend, and Carol, the therapist. Meanwhile, the house appears to develop an entity of its own as strange and random things happen. Is the controlling and manipulative Edward a killer? Is Emma a reliable narrator? An air of menace hangs over the house as danger begins to close in around Jane. The writing is lucid, sparse and beautiful. Pretty much like the house, and there is an air of claustrophobia in the story. This is a house with tragic beginnings and a strong character that is destined to trouble those who live there, you can just feel this. It is a good psychological thriller that keeps you reading without ever losing interest.

The perfect house will help people reach levels of perfection they never thought they could achieve. This is the house located on One Folgate Street. The Girl Before tells the stories of Emma and Jane, two occupants who lived in One Folgate.. Emma died under mysterious circumstances while living in One Folgate Street, and Jane is the current occupant. Both women look alike, and both were involved with Edward Monkton, the architect and mastermind behind One Folgate Street--both also happen to bear an eerie resemblance to Edward’s deceased wife. Jane begins to investigate Emma’s death, and by doing so, puts herself in danger.While the premise was interesting, it felt like the author was trying to cram pieces into a puzzle that didn’t fit. As a result, everything unraveled and it all became a little ridiculous.

And that wheel keeps turning and turning throughout the entire story. Some days that wheel grinds in the down and dirty. Some days it revs up speed and gains relentless traction.Emma Matthews lives in the \"once upon a gruesome time\". Her spin in the wheel is entitled \"Then\". Emma and her boyfriend, Simon, are desperate for a safe haven after Emma is attacked in their present apartment. Fear makes you snap at quick decisions. Desperately, they apply for residency at a slick, state-of-the-art building. Even all the mind-blowing questionaires and restrictions don't deter them. No books (Ah, c'mon now!), no cushions, no placemats, no personal items left out. And they sign on the dotted line.Edward is the award winning architect and owner of this granite luxury edifice. He lost his wife and young son in a freak accident not long before. Living in Japan for a time afterwards, Edward returns to manage his property. And manage he does......quite to the nth degree.Jane Cavendish resides in the time slot entitled \"Now\". She will be the latest occupant of One Folgate Street. She recently gave birth to a stillborn little girl and has been devastated by the loss. Jane, too, is seeking solace behind the walls of this highly efficient building. Although this \"covenant\" seems highly imposing and limiting, Jane signs on the dotted line as well.Soon Jane begins to connect occurrences in her present situation to those of Emma in the past. Things just don't seem to add up. What actually happened to Emma?The Girl Before will be made into a movie by Ron Howard. It brings to mind a Julia Roberts movie (1991) called Sleeping With the Enemy. Remember how the canned goods and spices had to be stacked just so and the towels primly arranged on the rack? Oh, sweetheart, this is just the beginning......The Girl Before is one sharp-ended story that reaches deeply into the slightly tilted minds of its characters.

A thriller has not made me this excited since Megan Miranda's All the Missing Girls. The story is told in alternating chapters between Emma, the girl before, and Jane, the current tenant of a very unique flat. While both women are searching for a living situation within their budgets in expensive London, their brokers both mention a possible solution. One Folgate Street has been designed by an architectural genius, Edward Monkford, but in order to live there, one must pass a series of vetting including a multi paged questionnaire and interview. This is where things just begin to get weird. I fear saying much more will give away the twists and turns within these pages. (As an aside, Emma's chapters are told without any quotation marks in the dialogue. While it takes some time to getting used to, it is very effective in differentiating between the two women's chapters. However I am completely curious as to why the author chose to use this device, if anyone knows, fill me in.)I thoroughly enjoyed how the author portrayed One Folgate - the apartment itself takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story. There are multiple triggers within this book. I feel if I mention them here, they would be spoilers. So. Pretty much, if it's a trigger you can think of, it's here.

Then there are the other rules - hundreds of them, seemingly waiting to trip you up, catch you unawares. There are also regular questions to answer, very personal and intrusive questions.

She soon discovers that Emma met an untimely death in the house, and begins investigating just what really happened there.The narrative certainly kept my attention, I really wanted to know what happened to Emma, but I found it hard to believe in Edward, AND his rules, so really that stopped me from rating this one any higher.*Thank you to Netgalley amp; Quercus for my ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.793349"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.793349"]]

By ‘‘manipulative,’’ I mean you’re more than pushed into liking specific characters and disliking others. So you do that. But despite having your thoughts about characters shaped by the author, you’re still manipulated some more as the story progresses. I don’t exactly like when that happens. I prefer to be exposed to all facets of someone’s personality and then be able to decide for myself who deserves justice and who doesn’t. This mystery novel is engrossing, despite it not giving us the liberty of making our own opinions on the protagonists and antagonists until the very end. The short chapters surely had their role to play in my being unable to put this book down.It’s slow, partly because it’s a mystery novel. If you’re familiar with the genre, you know that these types of novels take time to pick up because it’s all about the building part. It takes time for Jane to discover someone died in the house and it takes time for Emma to feel scared. That’s when things really become interesting.The death thing confused me, since I thought real estate agents were supposed to disclose info like that – especially when the previous tenants have died. But I guess there are places where no such law exists. Bummer, but it worked in the author’s favour. I enjoyed seeing this book shift from mystery to psychological thriller. I’m definitely the type to enjoy action in my plots, so I couldn’t do anything else but welcome the darker side of THE GIRL BEFORE, even if it takes time to reach that point. The characters also take time to become important in the reader’s eyes; most likely because they seem so normal, but that’s probably done on purpose to give the effect that this kind of story could happen to you or me. Anyone at all. But don’t worry; it’s very, very unlikely. Sleep tight now.

It was built by a techno-minimalist architect named Edward Monkford. There is an intense 200-question application, a face-to-face interview with the ones Edward personally approves, and even then..they rarely get the lease. And if you do, you have to live by strict rules and adapt to this minimalist lifestyle. It is all in the contract. Things like no children or pets, no curtains or rugs, everything must be put away at all times (including dishes, clothes, etc), no books, nothing left out on floors, no flatbed furniture, etc. Plus you’re required to keep the same cleaning service on, must open the house to visitors for architecture tours, and must take assessments every month to see how you change throughout your stay at One Folgate Street.Not my cup of tea to live under such a strict lifestyle. The two women in this story both went through a trauma before needing to find somewhere new to live on a budget. And One Folgate Street is a house that allows for people to live beyond their means (in terms of rent). Emma and Simon recently had a break in, so Emma needs to feel safe. Emma is the girl from then.And Jane’s chapters are marked now. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is reeling from the loss. For Jane the house feels like it could be a fresh start.

I’m just looking at how it worked into the plot and some scenes felt like added length as they added nothing to the story.The ending felt somewhat tame, though it was still satisfying. I guess it wasn’t as explosive as I was hoping. I liked the random application questions that were thrown in the story sporadically.

The sampler measured in as 17% of the total book, which is quite lengthy portion and definitely had my intrigue piqued. There are so many physiological thrillers available today that sell themselves as in the style of Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins. Very few actually come close to living up to the powerhouses in this genre. This book, however, deserves to sit beside them. This dark and brooding tale was alive with emotion and drew the reader into the tension of the tale. The story wasn't set out in chronological order and this provided room for the tale to slowly unfurl, and share its secrets with the reader at its own pace. The telling of the tale, as well as the setting of it, were as alive as the characters, and all three worked together to provide something suspenseful, shocking and totally unique!First ReadingI received this in exchange for an honest review from NetGalley. Thank you to the author, J.P. Delaney, and the publisher, Ballantine Books, for this opportunity.I have never read a sample of a book before and, to be honest, have never been interested in doing so. When I received an email proclaiming that I was eligible for a portion of this book I downloaded it to my Kindle without any real idea of when or if I would get to it. One day, however, I found myself short of time and eager for a quick read to finish, which is how I ended picking this up.I was hooked from the very first page! This sample contains a considerable quantity of the book, containing approximately twenty short chapters, and I flew through all of it in one sitting.Told from the split perspectives of Emma, in the past, and Jane, in the present, this chronicles the similar paths both their lives took once they became the occupant of the infamous 1 Folgate Street. Designed by cutting-edge architect, Edward Monketon, this house is unlike any other. And Monketon requires his tenants to live their life unlike any other, as well.This is the absolute definition of spine-tingling! This managed to make a modern house, full of straight lines and futuristic technology feel like a chilling, Gothic mansion, full of shadowed corners and ghosts of homeowners past. And all without dwelling on any of the melodrama associated with that genre.The no-nonsense style of writing mirrors the architect of the house and becomes just as much a function of the tale as the characters and the setting.I am so eager to uncover the mysteries concerning this unique and compelling thriller and can't wait until I can get the rest of the book in my hands!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.806500"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.806500"]]

I’m just loving these imaginative psychological thrillers coming out recently!!While this appears to be a debut novel, this author apparently has some experience with crime writing, having written this book under a pseudonym. I wish I knew who the ‘crime writer’ is- but I suppose that’s a mystery for another day. In the meantime, I hear this book might be the basis for a movie, and Ron Howard would be the director! So, if that isn’t enough to peak your interest, I don’t know what will. While this is yet ANOTHER book for ‘fans of ‘Gone Girl’ and ‘The Girl on the Train’, and yes, it does have the requisite ‘Girl’ in the title, this book stands on its own merits and needs no other comparison.Two very different women, both having suffered emotional traumas, move in, at different times, into a very affordable, unique, technologically advanced apartment that stresses a minimalist lifestyle. The apartment’s owner screens his tenants by having them fill out a lengthy questionaire, and insists they sign a contract promising to adhere to a strict set of rules… around two hundred of them,(!!!) and if they are not obeyed there will be conseqences. The story alternates between the first person perspectives of Emma and Jane as they describe their time living in Edward Monkford’s apartment building. As the story progresses, we learn the two women bear a striking resemblance to one another, are both attracted to Edward, despite his OCD tendencies, but, Jane discovers that the previous tenant… Emma, died in the apartment, an apparent victim of suicide. Jane becomes somewhat obsessed with Emma and her backstory, while her own personal relationship with Edward begins to deepen. But, her investigation into Emma’s death could come back to haunt her….While it may seem obvious who ‘the girl before’ is, and some may guess correctly, I admit I didn’t see the twist coming and was completely surprised by the way the story developed. The suspense is low key initially, with just a mild creepy feeling permeating the sterile environment the two women live in. But, as the story develops, a feeling of dread begins to grow, and before too long, I found myself immersed in these women’s lives, wanting to send out a warning signal, to advise caution, but didn't know who or what the main threat was. The writing is superb, as the author drew me in, held my attention, managing to evoke feelings of concern for the tenants, on top of creating the feeling of foreboding and dread, that kept me turning those pages. Of the two women, one is more controversial and the other is mildly bland, and were not necessarily people I related to or felt a kinship with, but I did feel sympathy for them and worried on their behalf, despite feeling frustrated with them at times.I was slightly conflicted by the ending, which was somewhat anticlimactic, in my opinion. Other than that, I thought this was a pretty solid thriller, with a unique set up, and kept me interested from beginning to end. 4 stars"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.809920"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.809920"]]

With a list of over 200 conditions that have to be strictly adhered to by whoever lives there and a very thorough interview process for would be tenants it is proving difficult to lease. The story focuses on two troubled women who live at 1 Folgate Street, Emma from the past, and Jane in the present.For the first half of the book I was totally hooked and read the novel at every possible opportunity. It was easy to see why this book was getting so much positive attention and plans to bring to the big screen so far advanced. I was already thinking this book was going to get a high rating off me but then I don't know what exactly changed but my interest suddenly dwindled. I totally understand why other reviewers are raving about it and I am pretty sure I will watch the film when released but unfortunately I didn't find the second half of the novel anywhere as powerful as the opening.I would like to thank Net Galley and Quercus books for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.812736"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.812736"]]

Both women had some sort of superbadawful they were trying to get over when an opportunity to reside at One Folgate Street presented itself.

I mean, first of all, it had the word \"Girl\" in the title, which was a clue that it would be bandwaggoning the tail end of a trend. And then, once I finished reading it, I found Emily May's review that made the connection between this book and Fifty Shades of Grey.Here is a list of all of the things I hated about this book:1. Edward. His character was completely unconvincing. I haven't read FSoG and I have no plans to do so. However, that book has permeated the pop culture to the level that even I was able to draw the parallels between his character and Christian Grey. \"I don't do traditional relationships,\" he purred, smoothly. \"I'm coming over, and I'm going to take you to bed,\" he told her (completely out of the blue, by the way). If a man said that to me, I'd meet him at the door with a sledgehammer and a restraining order. Not that Jane would have a sledgehammer, since it's probably a violation of the preposterous rules that she agreed to before moving into the house to have a sledgehammer. 2. BDSM. Never have I been so unconvinced of spanking in a book. Never.3. BDSM. When Emma called him \"daddy\" it literally came out of nowhere. The ultimate sexual non sequitur. Where in the hell did that come from? 4. Emma. Shut your fucking face you lying liar who lies. Honestly, she was one of the most unlikeable female characters in any book ever. She lied about everything. Everything that made her sympathetic turned out to be entirely false. There were three sociopaths in this book, and she was one of them. Are we supposed to like her? I'm unclear on this point.5. Jane. She is basically the equivalent of that dumb blonde in a horror movie who hides behind the wall of whirling knives instead of running the fuck away while she can. 6. It's treatment of trauma was totally surface and entirely based on the author's idea of what some one who has experienced trauma might do. 7. The house itself was entirely creepy and no one would ever live there. People who are alive, and who are not wax statues, do things that create clutter and mess. Even the tidiest house will have, at a minimum, a family photo displayed. Living in that house would be like living in a mausoleum. No one would voluntarily live in a mausoleum before they had actually become a corpse.8. The twist. I figured it out. Go away.9. The dual narrations in opposing chapters. Tired. Trite. Been done.10. The ending. Nice gimmick.So, yeah, there really wasn't anything I liked about this book. I should've known better, really, than to buy it. But can this trend of unrealistic characters and their behaviors in \"realistic\" fiction be over now, please?

I thought I knew within the first few chapters, but I was wrong--and I'm not telling, sorry.One Folgate Street seems to be the perfect place for those wanting a decent home, yet can't afford one... but it has a strange ability to change it's residents.... The house was designed that way... with a computer system running all the facilities, and interrupting lives at the most inopportune moment, with questionnaires to answer--to see if the tenant(s) are progressing properly. This computer system, called Housekeeper had several beneficial aspects to the home owner...recognizing who was in the shower, and their water preferences, noticing the amount of REM sleep they got, checking their stress levels....and more. Two women are each searching for a place to begin again. Emma, wants security after being violently burgled. Jane has just suffered the stillbirth of a perfect child due to hospital neglect, and needs to move on after quitting her high-paying job, and more importantly, leave the constant reminders that fill her present home of poor little Isabelle. The major problem both face are the terrible price of London flats, and the horrible state of those they can afford.Enter Edward Monkford, a gorgeous, controlling perfectionist with plans* for his architecture to change the lives of those who inhabit his pristine, mausoleum like, architecture. (His idea of architecture and life had changed drastically after the tragic death of his wife and son on the grounds of the building site, but few know of the ancient Japanese ritual that also took place there....) This house is built of only the best materials and is stunningly beautiful in it's minimalism. No wonder it's won awards. The walls are smooth pale stone, all appliances and fixtures hidden from the naked eye...Usually only the rich can afford his places, so why is this place so cheap? Because there's a catch. It begins with a huge questionnaire, with numerous, often seemingly odd questions that must be answered by any prospective tenants. Once finished with that process they are then made aware of a lengthy list of rules that would make life unbearable for most, even if smitten enough with the pristine, beautiful, award winning property to sign the list of rules (including no throw pillows, personal pictures, or books, just to name a few-this house is meant to bring order, peace, and better overall health to the lives of those who live inside). There were other rights to sign over in the lengthy small-typed package, a contract that the exhausted hopeful applicants rarely had the energy left to read closely. The final request was to send three recent pictures upon submittal. There was no secret that most hopefuls are quickly rejected by email--that precious few make it through the lengthy process and acquire an interview--the last hurdle. Not until later does someone take notice of a striking resemblance the accepted tenants bear--not only to each other--but also to Edward's dead wife. All attractive, with the unusual combination of dark hair, porcelain skin, and deep blue eyes.Emma and Jane both have that advantageous resemblance, and can't believe their fortune when chosen to live in this stunning, albeit artfully sparse, masterpiece house for only a pittance. They have no idea of the plans the architect has for them, and that they have become human guinea pigs.One of the best parts of this book for me is it's POV, which is separated by chapters. We have Then: Emma, and Now: Jane. Emma had lived in the house before Jane, but ends up dead. I thought she must be the girl before. In a way she was. When Jane finds out about her, this thriller becomes a chilling mystery. As the POV's are first person, the story of Emma is a bit difficult because she is a very unreliable narrator, causing us to believe her lies, until the story unwinds enough to see who she really is. I loved the way these two stories were interwoven, one picking up quickly where the other had just left off. In no way were these hard to follow, rather the tension mounted as the reader realized there was something strange about their commonality, namely--Edward. I found it ingenious the way they fit together, and especially creepy as on some of the pages there was only a question, either from the computer check-ups, or the original form, that was particularly relevant to the situation going on. These chapter endings served to keep me engrossed in the book, feeling the need to read the next one to find out more.(view spoiler)[Emma moved in with her boyfriend Simon--who passionately loved her--after the burglary that terrified her in her old neighborhood. Most personal items were not allowed in this clean lined house (one of the MANY rules), only a few items of clothing, some toiletries. Simon was not crazy to give up his beloved possessions, but Simon loved Emma far more, so he went along with it, as he always went along with Emma, wanting to make her happy. But soon, Emma is changing, she kicks Simon out, whom she thought she needed desperately weeks before. It's then that Edward enters her life....Yet, Emma had another problem: lies. She's told them to everyone, Simon, the police, the court, and Edward. To get out of the mess some of her lies have caused, she tells more lies--about people, lies that change their lives; and when she ends up dead...no one knows where to turn....the list of suspects is incredibly long, and her case remains unsolved unsolved.When Jane moves in, she is comfortable living in the home's simplicity. It's a new start. One in which Edward also becomes entangled. Soon, she finds out about Emma, and the resemblance (as well as the story of Edward's wife). Her time is spent trying to piece together Emma's death. It's a course that leads her into danger. I loved to watch her amateur crime solving, as she meets many of the people from Emma's past; but there are far too many suspects to get her mind around. Her life becomes endangered when the true murderer gains access to her house (again...not the one I expected), and a terrifying night of hide and seek follows, with fear around every corner; the reader can't help but hold their breath as the pages turn and mysteries are solved. Can Jane overcome the murderer? Or will she end up as Emma had? Another dark haired, blue eyed girl spilling her life-blood on the immaculate stone of this house? Jane actually holds a prize...one in which we find the true meaning of who The Girl Before really is. Can she keep the prize and escape this house, alive?

I went into the book without a lot of expectations. I decided to read this book based on the summary which sounded like it had the making of a good thriller. It turns out that I was hooked by the story almost immediately and found myself doing that thing where I promise that I will read just one more chapter and before I knew it, I had read half the book. This books tells two stories from two different timelines. Emma and Jane have both lived at the house at One Folgate Street. One Folgate Street is not your average house. It is a house with rules. Lots of rules. Rules that most people wouldn't even want to try to follow. If a potential tenant decides that they want to live in the house, the approval process is quite difficult and most are turned away. Emma and Jane were both approved. Emma moved in the house first with her boyfriend, Simon. Later, Jane moves in and learns that Emma died in the house.Both Emma and Jane were going through some very troubling issues when they moved into the house and hoped the move would give them the fresh start they want. Emma and Jane were both very interesting characters. I wouldn't say that I ever really liked them but I really became invested in learning what happened to Emma and wondered what would happen to Jane. The other key character in this book, Edward, was similar in that I didn't really like his characters but I couldn't help myself from wondering what he would do next.The way this book was laid out really worked well. The chapters alternated from Emma and Jane's point of view with Jane spending a lot of energy trying to learn what had happened to Emma. Sometimes the reader would see something happen to Emma just to have it happen to Jane in the next chapter. Instead of feeling redundant, it just added an extra layer to the story. The more that Jane became obsessed with finding out about Emma the more hooked I became. This was a book that was incredibly hard to set aside.My only complaint about the book is that I am not completely sold on the ending. I do like that the book took a lot of twists and turns that I didn't expect. For some reason the ending felt like a bit of a let down for me. I think that I had expected a bigger scene to help wrap everything up. I would highly recommend this book to fans of mystery thrillers. This book grabbed my interest from the first page and never let go. I look forward to reading more from J.P.

The Gone Girl comp is painful for me. That book is my favourite of 2013, and one of my favourite books of all time; I was incredibly excited about this book, not because of that comp, but because of the interesting amp; exciting premise. Unfortunately, the result is more like 50 Shades of Grey meets a pale, brutally-murdered corpse of Gone Girl.50 Shades of Grey? Yep, there's a devilishly handsome, accomplished architect that neither of the two (lame, weak, poorly-developed) women are able to resist; there's BDSM; there's even a frigging contract. I'll tell you this, though, guys: I've had more erotic headaches than this book. Seriously, this book is so replete with awful erotica cliches, I was cringing throughout, from such golden lines as:Yes please, Daddy.Or Edward, the architect, sticking his finger up some woman's vagina in the middle of a massive society party for famous architects (or something), and causing her to go weak at the knees with the daring amp; impossibility of this all.The problem is, there's potential here - real potential. I loved the description of One Folgate Street, and a few of the set pieces, such as when Jane finds Emma's sleeping bag abandoned in a hideaway in the house. I loved the idea, and the continued ideas - especially Edward's interrogation of Jane through his \"questions.\" I thought Jane's final decision was lovely and moving, and pointed towards a wholly different, quieter, but BETTER novel lurking inside the empty, glassy shell of this one: a contemporary novel about one woman's (not two's) impossible choices, longing for a child, and conflict with the control-freak father of that child. However, this book shows, frankly, what a wonderful success Gone Girl is, and why it's been so hard to repeat (except with The Girl on the Train, which had the luxury of at least being an entirely different novel behind the \"Girl\" veneer). The characters here are not well-developed; what was so wonderful about Gone Girl was its utterly unique ability to keep the twists within the focus of what we already knew about the characters. When Gone Girl twisted, it felt like whole new possibilities jumped up within the range of what we had already been teased amp; knew. In The Girl Before, on the other hand, characters are kept ambiguous and dully unlikeable in order for anything to be possible. Worse than that, though, when The Girl Before runs out of places to go, it lurches haphazardly into cliche and a straight-up Gone Girl ripoff, unfortunately borrowing the worse aspect of it: (view spoiler)[Flynn's penchant for false rape accusations, a pattern which is almost exactly duplicated here, with Emma falsely accusing not just one man but THREE SUCCESSIVE MEN of raping her (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 1], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.842206"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.842206"]]

Not something I could ever do, by the way. I love my possessions, especially my books. And no pets? Never. But anyway….The story is told in alternating chapters between past and present. Both women who chose the house have suffered loss or harm - a break-in while she was home by one and the loss of an unborn child by the other. So, they have their reasons for choosing something so different. In between the chapters, there are questions from the questionnaire the landlord gives prospective tenants, just so you can see how strange it all really is. This book was a mixed message for me. Some ideas were interesting, like the Japanese cultural ideas that Edward espouses. Or Jane’s comparing of her relationship with Edward to palimpsest or pentimento. But other things just really freaked me out. Like ikizukuri, which is just barbaric. I know, I'm freaked out at the idea of eating live seafood when this is a book about murder. But that sort of thing really sets the tone. There's also a dominance and sex theme. Not talking 50 Shades here, but the man having all the control and calling all the shots. Just not my cup of tea. I had no fondness for any of the main characters either. There's a decent twist towards the end of the book that keeps it interesting and then the ending is positively wild and engrossing. I'm really torn how to rate this. The first ¾ of the book was two stars, but the last ¼ was close to a four for excitement. Guess I'm going with a three. And what is it with the use of “girl” in titles, for pete’s sake? Emma is a woman. My thanks to netgalley and Ballantine Books for an advance copy of this book.

Perhaps he needs a fancy stay at a \"resort\" with soft walls because he's Looney tunes, orrrr maybe he just needs a stiff drink and a good psychiatrist. Either way, he's on the short list of possible suspects when one of the tenants dies in the house that's creepy enough to make you consider staying at the Bates Motel instead. Cue the scary piano/violin combo.The book is written with alternating chapters from the pov of the dead woman as well as the new tenant who is on a quest to find out the truth about what really happened in that house.So, needless to say... It's 2:25 am, and I'm scared to go to sleep. Because I finished this book. I had a whole bunch of mental notes I'd thought of, so I could point out all the unique and down right intriguing aspects of this story,but...that flew out the window, along with my sense of adult logic that tells me not to be afraid of the dark, or of the boogeyman that may or may not be lurking somewhere in the shadows. It's not my fault, it was this nailbiting story that frightened me because I couldn't figure it out. Usually authors give away teensy morsels that tantalize readers and allow them to have a strong suspicion about who's doin' what to whom, and who the psycho is. But oh no, not this time. J.P. Delaney is a talented lil sneak who knows how to make you feel like a 5 year-old hidden under the covers like a scaredy cat. If you enjoy adrenaline-inducing stories, you will love this one. It's complicated, has more twists and turns than a winding road, and the characters are a psychoanalyst's wet dream. Delaney must've done years of research to perfect the complexities of these characters. I'm not just saying that, either. If you choose to read this, you'll know exactly what I mean, because the knowledge in this book regarding a multitide of topics is nothing short of impressive.Normally I don't compare books, but it's safe to say that if you love books like The Girl On The Train, Before I Go To Sleep, Disclaimer or Gone Girl, then you will love this one too.Thanks to Netgalley for letting me read this in exchange for an honest review.

A novel that gained the eyes of editors around the world at the Frankfurt Book Fair and a bidding war started based on 53 pages. A soon to be made movie by Ron Howard. The story of a house and the women who lived in it. The past Emma and the present Jane. The narrative splitting between both characters; in many cases the story repeats itself and you see it from two different point of views. The owner of the house; the minimalist architect Edward and his over 200 stipulations to live in this house. A house that electronically control the environment, the light, the sounds, a house where you can't bring your life in to. I wasn't a fan of Emma she felt too weak and had no power whatsoever over the men in her life, I wanted to scream and shout and tell her to be stronger and not a weak person. Jane develops and evolves with the story and she grows on you. You feel her happiness and pain. Edward on the other hand is cold as ice... a perfectionist control freak, that I wouldn't know why any woman would want to be with him. Why should a woman be fine in living in a house that would cut off her water if she didn't put the dishes back or if she didn't clean the shampoo stain or some other reason... it makes no logical sense and it's 2017. It was a book that flowed nice even if it didn't make sense in some points, and in other parts the author did give early clues for future events that made them less enjoyable. It was a good book and I can see why people would buy it when it comes out."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.853708"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.853708"]]

I love reading reviews from my fellow book bloggers because I trust their opinions and know they won’t spoil anything for me, but on Goodreads/Amazon you just never know. All that being said, I had heard that The Girl Before was getting mixed reactions so I checked things out for myself and it seems people either love this book or they hate it. I happened to love it, but just know that it seems like it’s not for everyone. You have dual perspectives here, Emma is Then, Jane is Now. This style never fails to reel me in and by ten percent I was totally hooked. Emma and her boyfriend Simon move into One Folgate Street together, then two years later Jane moves in alone to start fresh after a tragedy. As the chapters flip back and forth, the similarities between the two women are frighteningly uncanny. One of the biggest complaints that I’ve seen about this book is that no one finds the premise believable. One Folgate Street is owned by an architect named Edward who is a rigid perfectionist to put it mildly. He’s created a sterile, modern home with new technology that’s amazing but also creepy. No house keys are needed, the shower remembers what temperature you prefer, etc. The application prospective tenants must fill out in order to be considered has two hundred questions. That’s right, TWO hundred and they are anything but typical. They require the applicant to answer moral dilemmas and they’re just very odd. He also requires a picture which is just bizarre. Would I ever want to live in a place with a tyrannical control freak as a landlord? No thank you. But as a premise for a book I thought it was fabulous and it didn’t bother me that it wasn’t exactly believable.Beyond what I’ve already discussed I won’t say more about the plot. This was a highly addictive and provocative read for me, a real page turner about the quest for perfection and the obsession that goes hand in hand with it. I was blindsided by one of the major twists and the smaller ones threw me for a loop as well. I can’t wait to see this play out on the big screen as Ron Howard is directing, I think it’ll be fantastic! Again, this seems to be a really polarizing read, you’ll either love it or hate it. If you’ve read it I would love to see which side of the fence you fall on!

After his wife and child died there in a tragic accident, (or was it?) Edward decides to rent the home, but only to those who pass his strict and lengthy interview process.

Jane, who recently lost a child and feels the stark blank walls are just what she needs to help recover, and Emma, the notorious 'Girl Before'.There are moments of great intensity here, but also there were some chapters that fell flat, which is part of why this didn't cut it as a 5 star for me. The other reason is that I really didn't like any of the characters, which made it hard for me to feel any kind of sympathy for their plights. I was hoping for a better ending, although to be honest I can't say just how, so it probably is the best ending possible.

Delaney"], ["date", "Nov 30, 2016"], ["review_text", "I received a copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest review.The Girl Before started out great. It's an addicting psychological thriller about two unrelated women who both, at different times, agree to move into an experimental house designed by minimalist architect Edward Monkford. The house comes with a long set of rules: no clutter, no children, no pets. Nothing but the absolutely essential. Chapters alternate between their perspectives following two different timelines; we have Then: Emma and Now: Jane. Though the young women don't know each other, their narratives parallel and we see Jane falling into the same patterns and making the same choices as Emma did, lending the story a tense air of inevitability - it's like watching two trains about to collide, and it's terrifying.This started out being one of the creepiest thrillers I've read in a long time. I raced through the pages in order to get to the bottom of the mystery. And then it all went downhill.I try my best to write my reviews without spoilers, but all of my problems with this book come down to the twists and reveals, so without further ado:(view spoiler)[1. Emma lying about being raped. On the one hand, I love unreliable narrators, especially in this genre. The fact of Emma being a pathological liar is fascinating, and it's fun trying to wade through her web of deceit to discern the truth. But then we arrive here, and... well. What a letdown. I'm not saying that false rape accusations don't happen. But in a society where allegations of rape are often met with scorn and skepticism, where alleged rapists are let out of prison after six months because of promising athletic careers or even appointed president of the United States, do we really need more fictional accounts of women lying about being raped? Especially seeing as the biggest name in this genre from recent years also focuses on a false rape accusation, it stings even more seeing it repeated here. Once was enough. (I won't name the title because of spoilers, but I think we all know what I'm talking about.)2. The reveal that Simon was the killer. This is one of the rare cases where I think I would have preferred the killer to be the person we all guessed it was on page one, rather than this outlandish twist. In Edward Monkford we have a fascinating and terrifying depiction of a narcissist and a sociopath, someone who seems from the outset perfectly capable of murder. While it seemed a bit too obvious that he was the killer, I couldn't help but to expect it. I wanted to see what drove him to that point, what was enough to make him snap. Even though I thought I had this book figured out, I didn't care. It was still addicting and tense and my heart raced as I tore through the pages, waiting for the final pieces of Edward murdering Emma to click into place. But no, it turns out that Edward's just a bit of an eccentric weirdo, and boring and possessive Simon is secretly crazy enough to murder the woman he loves. Simon was a jerk, there's no doubt about that, but I still didn't really buy this. Something that writers of the thriller genre fail to grasp is that sometimes less is more. Sometimes a bit of predictability is okay if your characters and situations are unique enough, which was certainly the case here. Readers are just as likely to enjoy a book because of its vivid characters - and Edward is certainly that - as unexpected plot twists. Twists like this need to strike a balance between shocking and believable in order to be effective, and this one relied too heavily on the former. 3. Down Syndrome being equated with imperfection and Jane being forced to choose between the epitome of perfection in the house and her 'imperfect' baby... really????? Could we not have told this story without going here??? [note: edited on 12/12/16. I originally incorrectly stated that the baby had autism, while it actually is Down Syndrome, as someone reminded me in the comments. I apologize for the error - I hadn't had the book with me at the time I wrote this review and was going off memory.] (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.866996"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.866996"]]

Unfortunately although I really did enjoy The Girl Before it didn’t turn out to be the “thrilling” read I was expecting. The story is told by two narrators Jane who moves into the perfect house, or is it? There are so many rules and regulations (200 in fact!) some of which are bizarre to say the least, and then other chapters are told from Emma’s POV whose mysterious death, becomes central to the plot. As the past and present become entwined you really can’t help wondering where the plot is heading. One Folgate Street is not a place I would choose to live in that’s for sure, with an obsessive and controlling landlord you just know things aren’t going to end well.The characters in The Girl Before aren’t the most likeable characters I’ve come across they are manipulative, selfish and self absorbed, but I must admit I was eager to learn more about them, and to see how the connection between characters would pan it. There are so many lies and half truths surrounding the two protagonists I found it difficult to know what to believe, but it certainly made me dislike them even more when the author reveals them. As Jane realises her life is running parallel to the tragic Emma’s events take a dark and sinister turn. Interestingly One Folgate Street takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story, which sounds strange but it actually adds a sense of malice and claustrophobia to its tale.Although I read this book in a day, and the plot is highly original personally I found the ease that the two women fall for their landlord less than credible, some scenes read more like 50 shades than a psychological thriller! When I picked up The Girl Before the first couple of chapters hint at the malice and darkness that surround the house, so I was expecting at least a few OMG moments, but unfortunately they never materialised. Don’t get me wrong it was an easy book to pick it up and read in one sitting as It did have elements that I enjoyed I’m sure The Girl Before will be loved by many, but even after the big reveal I was left feeling slightly disappointed as I expected so much more."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.886906"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.886906"]]

Emma, who lives there first, ends up dying under mysterious circumstances. The case can't conclusively decide whether her death was an accident, a suicide, or murder. Jane moves in a little more than a year later, after the apartment had been vacant for a year. As she gets settled in, she learns about Emma, and starts doing a little digging into her death. She quickly comes to find that Emma looks a lot like her, and that they both had relationships with the same man - the architect of the house. One Folgate Street is an architectural masterpiece. It's entirely integrated with technology, and is a beautiful home. That said, in order to live there, there are 200 rules that the tenant has to abide by. Yes, you read that right. 200! Including no books, pictures, or personal items. In addition to agreeing to the rules, in order to live in the apartment, tenants have to fill out a long survey, send in pictures, and complete an in person interview before getting approved. Why anyone would agree to all of that is beyond me. Give up my books?! No, thank you.The Girl Before is positioned as a thriller, though personally, I found it really slow moving. I didn't dislike the build up, but the story didn't feel like a thriller at all (and barely even felt like a mystery) until more than 70% into the book. Details and revelations come very very slowly, and leave the reader little room to guess what happened and what the end of the book would entail. What I did enjoy reading about were the details of the house. While I could never in a million years live in a house with that many rules, the technology the house employed was amazing. Windows that automatically darkened depending on the time of day? Shower heads that were responsive by person and knew the exact water temperature you liked? Yes, please! I also enjoyed that the story alternated between Emma and Jane, so we were able to understand both women and what happened to them as it was happening. That said, their voices sounded identical. It was really difficult to tell them apart, and I found myself flipping back and forth to chapter titles so I could remember whose part I was reading a few times. All in all, I did like the book. I loved the twists and turns that happened in the last 30% of the book. I felt like that's when it really turned into a thriller! The resolution was great, and I really loved the ending and final revelations! If you're looking for a book that's instant action from page one, this isn't the book for you. If you're comfortable with something slow building but interesting and willing to wait a while for the action, definitely pick this one up! I would rate this 3.5 stars if half stars were a thing on Goodreads. Because I loved the last 20%, I'll round up for Goodreads purposes.The Girl Before will be released on January 24, 2017. Thank you to NetGalley, J.P. Delaney, and Random House Bellantine for this eARC in exchange for an honest review.

I started reading and was hooked, so I went ahead and bought it.Five gritty, difficult stars for this whirlwind. I feel so used. I loved the first third of the book, hated the second, and decided that it was all horribly necessary at the end.I debated with four stars because I thought everyone in this book was gross. Even Jane. Not at first, at first I thought she was smart and mature and a really relatable, regular woman. But then she started making appointments with people to find out information and then challenging them when they told her what they knew. Like what? Why are you seeking people out just to argue with them?But as it turns out, all of it was necessary. Edward's ridiculous personality, the house rules that most (all?) independent women would find abominable, the terrible, sad situations that caused these women to allow themselves to be governed, the super graphic sex scenes that take the non-erotica-reading audience by surprise, the selfishness of every. single. person in this book. It is all so staunchly apparent 2/3 of the way through that I found myself really questioning the author's integrity. Why would Delaney hook me like that, get me to pay for the book, and then make me hang out with stupid, annoying, crazy people for the remainder?Well, because (s)he is a genius. As all my initial opinions started falling apart, I started tearing through the book harder. Not so much to find out the ending, but to find out if I'd really been duped. And I thought I had until the very last few pages.What a hell of an ending. After I finished it, I sat around thinking for a long time. I really wanted to give it four stars because I'm still disgusted by everything. But you see, that was the point.Not only that, I was dragged through all these undesirable emotions voluntarily. Someone was controlling my actions, my thoughts, my opinions the whole time, making me think I needed to keep going. But I kept on with it. I kept putting myself through it.

It's already being adapted into a movie, there is a lot of hype, and most people seemed to love it. I wasn't a fan of the frequently changing perspective. The premise of the book - although seriously far-fetched - was unique and the plot really was intriguing. My main issue, I couldn't get excited about any of the characters. They all just left me feeling....pretty much nothing. The one scene that triggered some emotion was the one involving food (if you've read this, you'll probably know what I mean).

There are obviously several twists and turns, and I enjoyed the latter half of the book more while other reviewers actually seemed to prefer the first half.

Most enigmatic is the architect – possibly of more things than just buildings, so the scene is set for a tense and fascinating story.So we get told both stories in alternate timelines – Emma, the girl before of the title and Jane, the current occupant of a house that will divide opinion on whether or not you would like to live in it. Both Emma and Jane definitely do but there are all sorts of hoops to jump through and for Emma it is not going to go so well….This is a clever, twisty and intelligent thriller that leads you down one path then another, exposes each character slowly but surely until you see who they actually are, it is a tense and fascinating build up to a finale that exposes the true colours of everyone involved. In the background, stark and watchful is this place they occupy, a modern and utterly engaging home that sounds both heavenly and irritating in equal measure.Great writing here – really really immersive, descriptively gorgeous, utterly creepy in some parts and an honest to God page turner.

There is an extensive application asking strange questions and then a private interview with the architect if the applicant makes it that far. There is a thick contract listing hundreds of rules that must be followed in order to live there. Who would want to live like that? The house is minimalist to the extreme although every item is top of the line. There is technology up the ying yang and a housekeeper and a gardener. Everything must be perfect. The computer system keeps track of you and even controls the shower temperature and your body's functions like blood pressure. There will be times when questionnaires must be completed. Until they are completed the house shuts down- no water, heat etc.  It didn't appeal to me at all but there are plenty of interested people.

Moving in even after finding a long list of rules to follow to rent the home Jane still believes this is the fresh start she needs. However, Jane finds herself becoming fascinated with finding out what happened to One Folgate Street's former resident Emma. Finding that Emma died within the walls of her new home Jane can't help but investigate to find out the truth for herself before she follows along in Emma's footsteps. The Girl Before is told from alternating points of view between Jane, the current tenant, in the present and Emma, the former tenant in the past. There are often times that there is no clear distinction with dialogue by use of quotations but this really didn't bother this reader at all. I found the story to be immediately gripping and intense as I learned what brought these two women into this home. Both characters in this story are coming from rough times in their lives and needing a new start. When shown the home at One Folgate Street they are told there is a long list of rules to live in the home anywhere from no books to no curtains or changes made to the home. Thinking that a new start is more important than possessions the contract is quickly signed by both and that is where the intensity begins. Now while I didn't quite find this a perfect read in my opinion as there were some things happening that I didn't quite agree with being added into the story I still found myself quite compelled with this one to give it four stars in the end. I'd certainly recommend checking this one out to the thriller fans.

To be granted lease, you must fill in a laborious questionnaire and attend a face-to-face meeting with Edward himself, and even then, you’re unlikely to be approved. There are a large number of rules you have to abide by when you live in the house, such as, no books (?!?!?!), no rugs, no curtains, and no leaving things out, such as clothes, toiletries etc, to name a few. You must also open your home for tours every so often and complete various questionnaires/assessments throughout your stay.So, I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking “who the hell would agree to that?” but as it happens, two women choose to live at One Folgate Street. Thanks to its low rent and dishy architect, both Jane and Emma are happy putting up with all the rules. Jane is the girl from now, and Emma is the girl before. Both women are troubled and both begin a relationship with architect Edward.What follows is a novel full of mystery and sex. If you’re also not into the whole “daddy” thing then this won’t be for you.Starting off this book, I was very worried I was going to hate it, because I’d seen a lot of people say the focus on kinky sex as a bit left field and overpowering to the plot. But, I managed to get over that when it started to appear in the story. In my opinion, it wasn’t as bad as many people had made it out to be and in any case, you can always skip over it. I thought it was going to go full 50 Shades at some moments, but it managed to avoid any of the scenes becoming too tactless.The mystery of “the girl before” is certainly intriguing and kept me hooked (for the first half, at least). I liked the way this was set out as Emma (before) and Jane (now) and how the chapters often mirrored each other so we could see the similarities in each of the tenants lives and relationships with Edward.What I didn’t like about this book was the characters, which I’m kind of assuming was the goal by Delaney? If not, then he/she (does anyone know and can inform me on their gender?) is pretty terrible at creating characters. Although Edward is set up to be our “villain”, I found Emma to be the most dislikable character, even after all was said and done. She was manipulative, unnecessarily forward, obnoxious and total putty in Edward’s hands. Women who can’t act on their own accord because of a man infuriate me, which is probably why I didn’t get on with this novel that well, as it’s kind of what the whole plot is about. I like my women strong and independent! The ending of this novel, no word of a lie, infuriated me. What a total cop out. People are comparing this to Gone Girl, LOL. The conclusion to this novel is the most overused and uninspired “twist” you can ever imagine. What a way to ruin a perfectly OK novel.Thanks to Netgalley and Quercus Books for giving me the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.952218"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.952218"]]

He is a minimalist and is very choosy about who he will lease the house too.

Both have gone through traumatic events in their lives and think the basic no nonsense approach may give them some stability. Emma wants to find a safe place to live after being burglarized and attacked in her home. She is approved to live at the house and moves in with her boyfriend Simon. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is looking to find some kind of solace in the stark walls of the house. Both Jane and Emma bear a striking resemblance to each other and to Edwards late wife.

Was it really just an accident or were there other mitigating factors resulting in Emma’s death?There were some aspects of this book that I did not like but it was still an interesting concept .

I’d like to give it a 3 for some good writing but the story was just so utterly unbelievable and the characters so unlikable that I don’t want anyone to think that I would recommend this book. The author is obviously very talented so I’ll stick with the 3.The premise of the book sounded interesting, and it certainly had some rave reviews from other authors: “Dazzling, startling, and above all cunning—a pitch-perfect novel of psychological suspense.“—Lee ChildFor a thriller to be a real page turner and give me that “tingly, tense” feeling, I need to find it believable. The two main characters, Emma and then Jane are our narrators and the chapters alternate between the two voices. Emma has suffered a personal trauma and supposedly is the perfect type of woman who would be taken in by Edward and his incredibly constricting rules for renting a home that he built with many things computer controlled by someone called “housekeeper”. She has to fill out an application that is about 20 pages long and asks incredibly personal and downright stupid questions. Emma moves in, a victim of Edward’s sociopathic, narcissistic personality and has a relationship with him. Jane is our present day narrator, another woman who suffered a personal tragedy, Same rules, same manipulation, same relationship with the multi-flawed Edward. When she starts to investigate what happened to Emma, Edward becomes furious and cuts off his relationship with Jane. She,however, continues to investigate Emma’s death including befriending her previous boyfriend, Simon. Here enters another component to the puzzle of what really happened to Emma.I could not believe that anyone would want to rent a place that has so many manipulative rules and does not allow you not to bring in anything personal to change the appearance of the stark, minimalist environment. Why would you rent from someone who is so domineering and obviously manipulative?What really put me over the line on this book however was the (*spoiler alert) introduction of the subject of Down’s syndrome. I’m not sure why the author chose to bring up this very sensitive subject in the telling of a psychological thriller. I felt it was out of place and served no purpose. There was also way too much sexual detail in this book, more than I felt was necessary to tell the story. The Girl Before we find out is not really Emma, but I'll leave that to the readers to find out.I would not recommend this book but I’m sure there is an audience out there for it. I did finish it as I wanted to read the outcome but that also was disappointing to me.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher and NetGalley."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.983200"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.983200"]]

I remember reading a sample of this book, and being blown away by its fantastic opening, thinking I can’t wait to continue reading this book! After days of wondering what happened to Emma, how did she die, did the technology in the house kill her or was it the architect himself, does the same fate await Jane? – So many questions! As soon as the full book was made available to me, I dropped everything to finish it.It’s not easy to become a resident of One Folgate Street; first there’s a long list of rules to abide by, second there’s a lengthy application form – not many make it that far, but if you do, you have to past the interview stage of the application process. However, once you’re a tenant, you get to reside in an ultra-minimalist house run by tomorrow’s technology, designed by a world leading architect.Two narratives run side by side in this book – Then amp; Now. Then was Emma, the former tenant, who died under mysterious circumstances, while living there. Now – Jane, the current tenant. From the offset, we know that the two narratives were going to become entwined and I loved the clever way they did.Aimed at fans of Gone Girl, this book does have the unlikeable characters, yes, but other than that I believe this book should stand alone as when I was reading this book, I had no thoughts of any other book, I was so wrapped up in this story. You do start off liking both Emma and Jane, but as the story progresses, Delaney shows us the true characteristics of both these women, and let me tell you, I was not prepared for their deceitful, vindictive nature; at times, some of their actions literally made me cringe. As events unfolded, I was shocked and pulled deeper into the story as I had no idea what was to come; the alternating chapters between Emma and Jane made this book so addictive, each narrative left me wanting more, this book kept me turning pages at great speed.I don’t even know why I bother to guess how books end anymore, or who the guilty party is, as again, here, I made my prediction, and I was so far off the mark, I’m not even going to say anymore. Overall, this book is fast-paced, thrilling and thoroughly addictive, I highly recommend it and I’m sure you’ll fly through its suspenseful pages just as I did.*Thank you to the author (JP Delaney) and the publisher (Quercus) for granting me access to a digital copy of this book via Netgalley*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.986644"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:46.986644"]]

O leitor fica sempre em dúvida se ele é o herói, a vítima ou o vilão desta história e embora seja uma destas coisas, não consegui gostar desta personagem, com as suas obsessões um pouco bizarras.Quanto às duas protagonistas, gostei de ambas embora tenha gostado um pouco mais da Jane porque teve um pouco mais de coragem do que a Emma mas são duas personagens muito semelhantes, às vezes com as mesmas dúvidas e pensamentos, portanto se não tivesse atenção ao início do capítulo que indicava que ponto de vista se tratava, acabava por confundir ambas.Eu não li ainda muitos thrillers psicológicos mas tenho vindo a gostar de alguns muito bem falados no mercado mas este infelizmente não me convenceu. Li o livro em dois dias pelo tempo disponível e fácil leitura mas tirando o mistério à volt do Edward e do assassino, o livro não puxou muito pela minha cabeça, achei tudo muito mediano.Ainda assim para os amantes do género acho que é um livro que merecesse sem duvida uma leitura, não esperem muito e já agora se conseguirem não leiam a sinopse pois revela um spoiler do livro. http://algodaodoceparaocerebro.blogsp..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.007361"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.007361"]]

It's important to be able to form an independent opinion of a book despite hearing and reading the reviews of others. This is especially difficult when a book has been receiving sterling reviews, as this one has. But in this case, I need to go against the grain and say that this read just didn't do it for me.Despite this book getting off to a promising start, I found that it very soon became unrealistic and lacked substance. I found myself constantly asking \"why would anyone do that?\" or saying to myself \"that would never happen in real life.\" Without giving anything away, let me just say that I don't know of a single person that would agree to rent and live in a house in which they were not even allowed to put a coffee mug down, or to leave the book they are busy reading in the lounge. A house that required the lessee to sign a lease with more than 200 prohibitive conditions, where the lessee had to agree to random surveys about themselves and if not completed within a short time period, certain fundamental appliances in the house would not work, like the shower or the stove. That is all just too ridiculously far fetched for me. I also found Edward to be an unrealistic character and one that would not get very far in real life, let alone be absolutely adored by not one but two woman. I know we are talking about a fictional story here, but still, for me a story must always be believable or else you lose me. So, unfortunately I must conclude by saying that this one won't make it onto my favourites list for this year.

I don't actually have a do not recommend pile but I may have to make one for books such as this.This book follows the stories of two women (eerily similar women but more about that in a moment) who have the opportunity to move into One Folgate Street- a techno-minimalist state-of-the-art architectural masterpiece- at a discounted rent as long as they can abide by a strict set of rules. The chapters alternate between Emma (then) and Jane (now) who discovers that Emma mysteriously died in the apartment and is determined to find out what really happened to her. The story heavily centers around romance, but a twisted and unenjoyable one. After each woman moves in, they are immediately approached by Edward, the owner/architect, who tells them bluntly \"I want to go to bed with you.\" Both women have the same response which is \"Oh, how intriguing. Well, alright then.\" Not... how creepy I don't know you? No thoughts about the potential complications that could arise from sleeping with the notoriously neurotic owner of the building? Not to mention that as the women actually get to know Edward he clearly has some major control issues and so I just couldn't understand their attraction towards him. I'm already rolling my eyes, but then the relationship spirals into a dominating, controlling, obsessive mess that became seriously cringeworthy.I considered DNFing at this point- and I never DNF- but told myself maybe it would be twisty and turny enough to redeem itself and I pressed onward.

Having been a victim of an armed robbery she no longer feels safe in the flat she shares with her boyfriend Simon. Convinced a new house would help with her new start Emma amp; Simon go house hunting but nothing in their price range seems right or, more importantly, safe enough. That is until they visit One Colgate street, a beautiful minimalist house designed by the mysterious (and handsome) Edward Monkton. The only problem iis that to live there you have to agree tiotio follow 200 very strict and bizarre rules, fill in a lengthy questionnaire anbd be interviewed by the architect himself. Despite all this, and her boyfriend's reservations, Emma iis determined to live there. She is therefore thrilled when their application gets approved as she is sure the house will help make her a better person and help aid her recovery from the roibbery. Now: Jane us another lady who really wants to leave her past behind her with a move to a new house. Having recently suffered a still birth Jane can't bear to stay in the house she expected to brinbg her baby daughter home to. Like Emma, she immediately falls in love with One Folgate Street and is convinced that iit will be the new start she needs. Whilst meeting with the architect she finds herself a little attracted to him, so when flowers start arriving she flatters herself thinking they are from him. However a chance meeting with the man leaving the flowers leads to her discovering they are meant for Emma, the lady that used to live there and sadly died in the house. The man leaves before Jane can discover moire leaving her confused and a little uneasy. I've unfortunately had to stop reading this book as I was finding Jane's story quite upsetting. I lost my son, Christopher, at 24 weeks and Jane's experiences were too like my own and bought back a load of really bad memories. I don't know if the author has experienced something similar but it his description bought a lump to my throat, particularly the attitude of the hospital to it all. There were parts of the book I was enjoying up to that part. The dual story line was interesting and the lives of Emma and Jane echoing each other helped to build the tension and made for a interesting read. I wasn't too sure where the story was going as it seemed to deviate off into fifty shades of gray territory at times which was a little confusing. Despite her story being a hard read I liked Jane as a character and found her to be quite sensible. I also understood her more as I knew exactly how she was feeling. I wasn't so sure I liked Emma as she seemed a little silly and out of control and I found her a little annoying to be honest. This book has had a lot of great reviews and hype on social media and I would encourage anyone to read it for themselves and make up their own minds. If you have suffered the loss of a child I would say you should avoid this book as it does make for painful reading. Thank you to Quercus publishers for giving me a copy of this boom to review. I'm glad I tried it as I would have always wondered about it but it was just ok hard for me to finish. I wish there had been a warning regarding the child loss story as I wouldn't have read it."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.039427"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.039427"]]

The Girl Before, really is a book that grips you, it is compelling, breath-taking and has more twists than twister. This is a book that really will tick all the boxes for fans of the psychological thriller, there is the mystery, the intrigue, the changes of pace and twists that you cannot predict to where and when, and like a magician JP Delaney is not afraid to use the sleight of hand.This is thriller is two stories that become one around One Folgate Street, a perfect house for some, with a set of rules for all tenants that are constantly assessed by the technology around the house. The house is designed to be perfect, to some austere to others an architectural dream and to all residents an experiment in a new way of life, for the better.Edward Monkford designed One Folgate Street after the death of his wife and child and it is in a way a monument to them as well as pushing the boundaries of design. The house is not for everyone is it is very minimalistic mixed with cutting edge technology, its own housekeeping system that manages everything within the house, including the tenant. Before a tenant can move in they have to sign a legal document to show that they will not break any of the 200 rules that are in place to manage the house.The story is split in two, between Emma (Then), and Jane (Now) and how they both lived within One Folgate Street and its rules. We also discover the tragic reasons that both are happy to do away with many of their personal possessions to live a new austere life, which Edward Monkford observes and manages for them.Emma and Jane are two totally different people and we see their stories unfold separately but at the same time see how Monkford influences both their lives. Both have been through traumatic events in the life and are looking for change, the stories are told in both the past and present tense which helps to draw you in. At the same time, all the chapters are separated by various psychoanalytic questions the sort that are taken during a psychometric test so there is no right or wrong answer.Throughout the book, we see that both Emma and Jane have obsessions that seem to take over everything that they are doing. Jane’s obsession is Emma and how she lived and died within the house and whether there was any foul play in her death. Jane’s obsession of Emma is destructive in part especially when she feels like the house is spying on her.This book is punchy and will easily become a bestseller and it is understandable why this has already been optioned for film production.

This book is on lists everywhere as one of this years \"it\" books for thrillers. I enjoyed the book, but I also had some problems with it. My husband is an architect so I could relate to much of the details in the story that were architectural and I appreciated that research went into those parts of the story to make it more authentic to the character. I liked the way that the story was told in alternating chapters between our two main female narrators. I thought it was very interesting and creative how the author would tell the stories that were parallel and different at the same time, without confusing the reader. The story itself was interesting and there were little easter eggs throughout the story that helped you figure out who the killer was. However you didn't really arrive at that until about 15% left in the book, although you may have suspicions you are never really quite sure who \"done it.\" I also liked that there were multiple references to Breakfast At Tiffany's through the book, as that is one of my favorite movies. I found the story to be engaging and interesting. I did get to points where I did not want to put it down.There were only a few things that were off putting. The biggest was the author's overused phrase \"he/she goes\" when explaining about another characters talking to the narrator. Now, I read an unfinished copy so that could very well be edited out by the time this hits shelves. Another thing that bothered me is that when you get to about 50% the book suffers from a lot of repetitiveness. It seems that we keep hearing the same thing over and over for some time before the story finally starts moving forward again. That slowed the book down considerably for me. To me it didn't seem that there was a purpose for the story to keep repeating the same information continuously. However, once it started moving again, the story gripped you until the very end. Overall I did enjoy the story and would read more by this author.

Read it in two days.I won this book from the Goodreads giveaway program - an advance reader's edition - and am quite glad I did. I didn't know what to expect, but this was one great read.Told from the POV of two alternating MC's, both young women, in present tense. However, one woman, Emma, is labeled as 'Then,' and the other, Jane, is labeled 'Now.' This makes the story unfold in a rather linear fashion, even though Emma's story is happening prior to Jane's.Confused? Not if you're reading the book. Both women, at different times, elect to live in a highly technologically 'advanced' house designed by an enigmatic and exacting architect. There are a hundred 'rules' to follow in order to live in the house, including no rugs, no books, no pets, and so on, but the house is almost a living thing, digitally wired/enhanced in such a way as to eliminate most 'clutter' and complexity from life. It's clean living elevated to the nth degree, without doors, with all clean lines, smooth surfaces, and just the barest necessities provided. It's warm and clean and safe, and if you hate clutter, you'd love this house.(Myself, I like a little clutter.)Anyhow, both young women are coming from a difficult place - a burglary and possible sexual assault for one, a terrible miscarriage for the other. The opportunity to 'start fresh' and live in such an architectural wonder is appealing to both, but with different outcomes. The way their lives intersect, and what happens when one, then the other get involved with the architect who designed the house, leads to a murder mystery, and revelations that are equally surprising.It was an intriguing read and I've heard that a movie may be in the offing, directed by Ron Howard. Regardless if true or not, I highly recommend this to suspense/thriller/mystery readers.Five stars.

Das Cover und der Titel haben sofort meine Aufmerksamkeit erregt, obwohl ich langsam etwas durcheinander komme mit all den Bücher, die irgendwas mit 'Girl' im Titel tragen. Andererseits ist der Buchtitel durchaus passend für die Geschichte.In der Geschichte begleiten wir Jane, die uns durch die gegenwärtige Zeit führt und Emma, die wir in Rückblicken kennen lernen. Jane hat einen schweren Schicksalsschlag hinter sich und hat nun die Chance auf einen Neuanfang in einem technisch hochmodernen Haus. Das Haus ist sehr speziell und stellt gewissermaßen Ansprüche an seine Bewohner - es verfügt kaum über Möbel, strahlt allgemein keine Gemütlichkeit aus und alles funktioniert digital. Als Jane erfährt, dass ihre Vormieterin, Emma, im Haus gestorben ist, fängt sie an zu recherchieren und deckt so ungeahnte Dinge auf.Durch den Wechsel der Perspektiven lernen wir beide Figuren sehr gut kennen. Allerdings sind sich die beiden nicht unähnlich, es dreht sich oft um ähnliche Begebenheiten, so dass ich manchmal mitten im Kapitel zurückblättern musste, weil unklar war, aus welcher Perspektive ich gerade lese. Beide Frauen haben recht naiv und gutgläubig gehandelt, was mich manchmal schon etwas aufgeregt hat. Wie oft kann man bitte das Schrillen sämtlicher Alarmglocken überhören? Und warum kamen den Damen teilweise erst Monde später Gedanken, die quasi auf der Hand lagen? Nichtsdestotrotz haben mir beide Perspektiven insofern gefallen, dass ich das Buch kaum weglegen konnte. Der sogenannte 'charismatische' Besitzer und Architekt des Hauses war mir jedoch die unerträglichste Person des Buches. Edward wies so viele Parallelen zu typischen männlichen Hauptfiguren in New Adult Romanen auf, dass ich nicht umhin kam, ihn als eine Art 'Psycho-Mr.Grey' zu sehen.Trotz der gewöhnungsbedürftigen Figuren, habe ich die Geschichte in kurzer Zeit durchgelesen. Anfangs war mein Lesefluss etwas gestört von der Tatsache, dass in den Rückblenden die wörtliche Rede nicht gekennzeichnet war, daran habe ich mich aber schnell gewöhnt.Im Verlauf gab es einige Überraschungen und auch das Ende gehörte für mich nicht unbedingt zu den vorhersehbarsten. Alles in allem fand ich das Buch durchaus überzeugend. Übrigens ist auch schon eine Verfilmung geplant, die ich mir dann gerne anschauen würde.*Rezensionsexemplar"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.060780"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.060780"]]

Debo decir que al libro le cuesta un poco arrancar y tarda demasiado en centrar la historia, por tanto si os decidís a leerlo, no tiréis la toalla a la primera de cambio porque a partir de la página 100 se pone más interesante y empiezan a suceder bastantes cosas. Tengo sensaciones muy encontradas respecto a este libro. En ocasiones lo encontraba un poco plano pero el final me convenció bastante y le dio sentido a todo. Pero a pesar de ser un thriller, creo que es uno de esos libros que necesitan reposar unos días para reflexionar sobre él. Para que os hagáis una idea, sería el resultado de meter en una batidora a: \"La magia del orden\" de Marie Kondo, \"50 sombras de Grey\" y un thriller de moda como podría ser \"La chica del tren\" o \"El método 15/33\" de Shannon Kirk.Los personajes son bastante oscuros y todos tienen mucho que ocultar, es complicado saber cuánto hay de cierto en las palabras de cada uno. Las víctimas se vuelven verdugos, y viceversa, en un abrir y cerrar de ojos.Os preguntaréis si era predecible, pero normalmente procuro dejarme llevar por la historia sin pensar más allá y, en este caso, como lo leí prácticamente en el mismo día, tampoco tuve mucho tiempo para armarme mis teorías. Muchas veces hay que meterse en las historias sin intentar adivinar lo que está pasando y dejar que la historia sea la que te sorprenda.En resumen: si os gustan los thrillers es una lectura obligatoria.

The presentation of the story definitely hooked me as there were two narrators and two timelines. That said, both women bore striking resemblances to one another in appearances and experiences. This strengthened my belief that it was a plot I'd already read. Then things started to change shape. None of the characters are particularly likeable but the narrators also turn out to be somewhat unreliable which I found intriguing as I looked at the way information was cleverly presented to the reader to lead the thought process off direction without the narrator changing the story within her own head. The sex is a little too salacious for my taste yet details were sparse, innuendo doing the most work. Besides the sex, the book offered a compelling thriller with story twists I didn't see coming, red herrings planted just so, then discredited, then questioned, then new possibilities arise...Solid thriller.

Delaney's THE GIRL BEFORE has such an alluring premise and there moments where I couldn't put it down. But the far-fetched plot points, pseudo-sexual dominant storyline, and over-abundance of twists and turns left me feeling less than enthused about the novel overall.The story follows Emma and Jane, two women separated by time. In the past, Emma, who is still suffering the effects of a recent home invasion, moves into One Folgate Street with her adoring boyfriend. In the present, Jane is recovering from the loss of her child and hoping to start anew in the house. Designed by renowned minimalist architect, Edward Monkford, One Folgate Street is well-known in the London renter's market. But its occupants—the ones who get through vigorous application process—must abide by an exhaustive list of terms and conditions. Jane becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Emma, the girl before her. But the closer she gets to the truth, trouble follows her putting her life in danger. Is Edward a psychopath desperate for control? Or is there something else going on?On one hand, I reached a point in THE GIRL BEFORE (albeit late in the novel) and I absolutely couldn't put it down. Like Jane, I was desperate to find out Emma's truth. What exactly happened to her? Why was Jane's experiences in the house almost identical to Emma's?But what I wasn't expecting was to be given a dark sexual storyline (just FYI—it's not a romance), that came out of nowhere. It was bizarre. That aspect of the book really threw me for a loop and it wasn't something I enjoyed at all, especially all the \"Yes, Daddy\" talk.I liked the duplicitous characterization that played out in the novel. That led to some interesting revelations for the reader. The transitions between the alternating points of view was seamless, but sometimes due to the characters' almost parallel storylines it was confusing at times to distinguish the two women's story arcs.\n  There was a time when One Folgate Street seemed like a calm, serene haven. Now it doesn't. It feels claustrophobic and mean. Like the house is angry with me.\nEmma's chapters are written without quotation marks, something that was a deliberate choice of style. Though, I'm not sure what it was meant to accomplish. A form of minimalism? To emphasize that she no longer had a voice in the present time? This took some time getting used to and it made it a little more difficult to read. Had I completely understood this writing style choice, maybe I could be more forgiving, but it didn't really make sense to me. The ending felt really rush and, if I'm honest, contrived where Jane was concerned.. We're given almost no resolution with Edward's character, which was disappointing to me.I can definitely see the commercial appeal of this novel and hence, why there is a movie deal. It's a blend of a dark sexual thriller and a whodunit with suspects and motives in every direction. But several plot points didn't work for me and didn't enjoy the book as a whole.*  Thanks to Ballantine Books for the chance to read an early copy.

This book tells the story of Emma before and Jane Now. Both women who have had traumatic things happen to them in their lives and through a long application process are able to rent One Folgate Street. A home built by an eccentric architect who suffered the loss of his wife and son. The home is very stark and occupants must abide by a very long rental agreement.EmmaEmma moves into One Folgate Street with her boyfriend, Simon, after a break in at their home. Soon things start to change and Emma begins a relationship with the strange, handsome architect.JaneJane moves into One Folgate Street after a traumatic loss. She finds the home to be interesting but not as interesting as the architect and the story of the loss of his wife and his relationship with it's former occupant, Emma.I loved how the chapters flipped back and forth between the two women's stories. This made the book a very fast read. Things never got dull. There really is not down time in this book. No long descriptions, no wordy prose. It was actually quite nice to read a bit about one woman in the past and then read about the other woman in the future. Sometimes when books have multiple POW's being told it gets tedious. Not in this book. This is this books strong point IMO. Though going back and forth in time and reading each woman's POW, it soon becomes apparent that the two women are tied together somehow. Even the house itself is like a character in the book as it is built to learn about them and to help make them \"better\".Not everyone is as they seem in this book. I really loved that aspect. Who is telling the truth? Who is the wolf in sheep's clothing? What really happens? Who can we trust? I really enjoyed the twists and turns. This was a very fast read. Very enjoyable and well thought out. Is it the best book I have ever read? No, certainly not but it is a very enjoyable book. Sometimes it is just a pleasure to sit and read a book that grabs one's attention, is entertaining and makes one think.

For one of the first times, I decided to look at reviews before I read. I’m not sure why there are comparisons to Gone Girl or the Girl on the Train beyond the titles, though there is a similar tone in voice to Girl on the Train. That aside, I do think Gone Girl and Girl on the Train were stronger in suspense and tension and also in dealing with psycholical aspects of their characters. But I'm no psychologist so who knows.The setting, a house, in this story is as much a character as the two protagonists, Emma and Jane. They both come and live in One Folgate Street — a perfect and beautiful ultra-minimalist house designed by an obsessive and enigmatic architect named Edward. The house can sense their moods, changes lightning, trace their steps through the house, and monitor everything from the tenants weight, items in the fridge in the cupboard and a host of things that would take a special tenant to cope with. It also has a state of the art security system.Emma, we learn from the blurb, has died in the house after living there for a period with her boyfriend. When Jane comes to live there a few years after Emma’s death it’s hard not to wonder how Emma really died and if Jane will suffer the same fate. I did decide that I knew who the antagonist was very early. This was a little disappointing, and there was a moment two thirds of the way through, where I became very weary of Emma’s constant change of story and at one point it became completely illogical to me --- but that moment passed to some degree, and when it was made clear who the antagonist was, I had that sense of dread till near the ending."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.097476"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.097476"]]

They all seem to be female and they all must agree to an elaborate set of conditions in the lease. The book is told in alternating chapters by two tenants, Emma (the girl before) and Jane. My initial problem with the book was that Emma and Jane aren't girls. They are grown-ass women who should not be so stupid..the whole premise of the book is ridiculous. Unless you have been homeless and living on the streets for six months you would not be desperate enough to sign a lease with 200 conditions with respect to which you will be punished if you do not comply Your mandatory cleaning service is required to spy on you and report infractions to the landlord. And for this you get to live in a house that would make an egg look over decorated. Also sex with Monkford seems to be an unwritten part of the deal (not that either Emma or Jane showed the slightest reluctance). I should know better than to try to read books with \"girl\" in the title. A lot of sex and two incredibly stupid women - this book was definitely not for me.

I received a gorgeous copy of The Girl Before when I was at Harrogate last year, it’s totally white apart from the orange edged pages and the title and authors name are embossed on the cover. But even if I thought that the visual appearance of my copy was stunning it didn’t prepare me for the perfectly pitched plot on the inside. Goodness me I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK! I may even keep it beside me for a little bit longer-I’m not quite sure I’m ready to let it go just yet!Everything about this book worked for me, apart from one little thing and I’ll come to that later! I loved the dual plot thread of Emma (Then) and Jane (Now). Emma’s story felt almost theatrical, and with no speech marks in her chapters there was also a more voyeuristic feeling. That, combined with the sense of creepiness that builds gradually, made me feel as though we were also part of the “housekeeping”in the home that separates the two women by three years. I felt more of a connection to Jane from the very start and have to say that I felt her experiences were handled in a very compassionate and perceptive manner. She was my perfect heroine, intelligent, fearless and strong minded but never easily interpreted.This was a perfect “read in one addictive session” book as I was desperate to find out what secrets the house at One Folgate Street was hiding. Watching the dual stories of Emma and Jane come crashing together was utterly compelling. The one teeny tiny little fly in the ointment for me was Edward, a character that I found to be a little too “Christian Grey” at times, more of a caricature than I would have liked but weirdly enough, he did work within this whole concept of control that ran through the narrative. I couldn’t imagine either of the women falling so deeply under his spell, there was little charisma there for me but each to their own I suppose!  Just don’t get me started on the list of questions that sat in judgement at the start of each chapter! My moral compass definitely found them to be a little more challenging than I would have liked and they certainly caused some rather heated debates within this household!I’ve read that Ron Howard is going to be directing the film version of this book. Now, I have a great respect for him as a director so he had better do this book justice! I’m particularly worried about comparisons with The Girl on The Train as I really didn’t find that film version sympathetic to the book. I do hope that they don’t make the same error here in relocating the setting to New York. Or similar. One of the things I loved about this book was the whole architectural concept, the house at One Folgate Street and the city of London, incorporating the museums, which all seemed so quintessentially British to me so I will be keeping everything crossed!This dark and sometimes disturbing book is proving to be a bit of a Marmite read, having now looked at what other reviewers are saying. It surprised me by surpassing my expectations so I’m sticking my head above the parapet and saying I LOVED IT! So, J P Delaney, whoever you are, I’d like more of the same please!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.108172"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.108172"]]

I enjoyed every page of this thriller.The story is narrated by the two main characters Emma and Jane in a typical Now amp; Then style (where Emma is “then” and Jane is “now”). So, both girls are looking for a new place to move in. Each one suffering some personal trauma and seeking a new start in a new home. After a lot of search, each in her own time finally reaches One Folgate Street, which is beyond perfect. It’s very calming with perfect design. A masterpiece. A dream comes true. However, the owner has terms. Very strict rules actually. As bizarre as this seems, each girl, desperate to be the tenant of this masterpiece, approves to the terms and gets into the process of the application and interview hoping to be the lucky accepted tenant. And what a happy surprise for each to be asked to an interview with the owner and then accepted as the new tenant.Jane is attracted to the handsome seductive owner at once. He is too. And thus, their relation starts. But Jane has her doubts when she knows about the previous tenant and the mysterious crime. As she searches for the truth, she takes the reader with her in a roller coaster of twists and turns where nothing is what it seems to be. I loved this roller coaster a lot. I tried to be the smart girl all along and guess what’s next. Whenever I thought “That’s it. Got you!!” I found my guessing to be wrong. Ha! I always love the double narration and the now and then style. I was caught in and desperate to know what’s next.The handsome seductive owner of One Folgate Street is another issue. He is dark, mysterious yet you can’t help but love him. This is one of the few times when you just like the supposedly villain of the novel. Just like in “Jane Eyre”, or was I the only one who loved Rochester?I also loved the End. I will not be the silly girl who spoils it for you. I will only say that I liked it.The audiobook was also great. I loved listening to it going back and forth between the audiobook and the eBook.Finally, for those who enjoy psychological thrillers, you should read The Girl Before. I highly recommend it.** Special thanks to NetGalley amp; Ballantine Books for supplying my copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review **For all my reviews please visit http://www.meshascorner.net"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.110826"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.110826"]]

Its tormented twistiness tugs at the fraying strings of the characters as they live in the shadow of a peculiar architect’s unconventional vision of perfection.Two distinctive, yet interchangeable, time periods, “then: Emma” and “now: Jane”, begin to reveal the secrets of One Folgate Street. The property itself is quite extraordinary, but so are the uncompromising terms which must be obeyed in accordance to a restricted covenant detailing specific demands of anyone who is granted permission to live there.Emma and her boyfriend Simon, the previous tenants, were at the centre of a break in at their previous home. Emma needs to feel safer and the hi-tec security of this new property offered that, it’s just the rest of their lives that needed fixing. Jane, the current tenant, suffered a stillbirth. She’s grieving and is striving to start again. A clean slate she what she needs, with nothing holding her back just a genuine desire to be content, process her loss, and try to curb her curiosity about the death of The Girl Before.Is it possible for any tenant, no matter how meticulous the selection process, to live up the high standards of such a minimalistic environment, bordering on an impossible regime? Even after jumping through hoops, can they truly reap the full benefits of living in this pristine, clutter free, and questionably affordable property?Well, we soon discover the answer to that question as we meet the key characters desperate to change their lives when completing a curious questionnaire, which initially tests their integrity for selection to their first interview. However, the psychoanalysis continues while they live at One Folgate Street, assessing their quality of life and whether it has improved since becoming a resident.The reasoning behind the odd rules and why these particular individuals were selected is drip fed into their blurring stories. It’s as though the architect’s desire for perfection for the building and the tenant becomes inseparable. The inflexible, obsessive, supremacy of Edward Monkton knows exactly how he wants his plans to perform and there are certain parts of his tenants’ lives that are surplus to requirements.The psychological drama rattles unremittingly until its toxic snake bite of an ending. For a simple catalyst of property hunting to ignite such a perfect spark of intrigue is just pure genius.

After a personal tragedy takes a hold in her life, Jane decides to make a few changes. She leaves her job for another and decides to also leave her home, beginning her search for somewhere better. Upon house hunting, a real estate agent offers her a look into One Folgate Street, where the demands of the house are quite odd, but the house itself made architecturally stunning. Jane takes up the offer on the house and soon finds that there's something eery about a place that's too perfect.

There have been so many \"girl\" books as of late, that sort of always have the same plot and not much of just being thrilling.However, once I began reading, I had a feeling this one was it for me despite not being able to pick up a thriller for quite some time.Immediately, I was hooked. This story was fast-paced and intriguing, so much so that I found myself up late at night unable to put it down, for fear of not being able to catch up and find out all of the answers. I enjoyed the story being told in Emma's (then) and Jane's (now) point of view. I did not find myself getting confused, even though throughout the book you find parallels between the two women and their lives. Though these women are both so different, you can see what similar decisions they make that lead them to ultimately begin living the same life.The writing and the characters were it for me. At times there was such dark writing as we get to see more of Jane's and Emma's history and what has brought them to One Folgate Street, and then we see this vivid writing with details of architectural work and character descriptions.I even became slightly interested in architecture along the way, so props to that! I very much enjoyed Jane, more than Emma, and found myself rooting for her towards finding answers and getting herself out of fate's way. She has this strong independence in her that you don't see in Emma, or in any other character, that I loved.Overall, I had a really great reading experience and I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a thrill. The writing, the characters, the mood will get you hooked and even you'll find yourself marveling at the odd wonder of One Folgate Street."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.133878"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.133878"]]

However, found it a bit impossible to believe at some points, sounded like a TV drama more than a thriller. I found myself thinking - really? People cant possibly be that stupid, right? Or I am just naive. So yes, I found one of the main characters annoying. Very annoying, she just could not decide what kind of person she is, and that melodramatic jumping from being broken victim to strong crazy sexy woman was ridiculous.

Delaney estreia-se no mundo editorial com A Rapariga de Antes, um thriller psicológico que tem tido bastante aceitação da parte dos leitores, após a sua publicação no início deste ano. Na realidade, trata-te de um pseudónimo do autor inglês Tony Strong, que para além de publicar com o seu nome, tem vários livros editados com o pseudónimo Anthony Capella (também publicado em Portugal).Por causa do hype em redor deste lançamento e porque recentemente este género me tem revelado boas surpresas, a minha curiosidade ficou bastante aguçada e foi com avidez que iniciei esta leitura. A narrativa alterna capítulos sob o ponto de vista de duas mulheres, Emma no passado e Jane no presente, enquanto o leitor vai acompanhando a ida de ambas para o n.º 1 Folgate Street, uma casa londrina bastante sui generis e que desde o início do livro parece tanto uma personagem real como as duas mulheres.Esta casa é uma criação única do afamado arquiteto Edward Monkford, que só permite que alguém lá resida se cumprir uma série de requisitos e se comprometer a seguir várias regras para lá morar. Tanto Emma como Jane passam no teste e acabam por se envolver com Edward, assumindo a história um paralelismo afetado pelo ambiente peculiar da casa. Jane acaba por saber que a anterior inquilina, Emma, morreu dentro da casa em condições algo estranhas e decide investigar o passado de Emma, o que a leva a caminhos sinuosos e cheios de revelações.A Rapariga de Antes é um livro que fala de obsessões. A mais evidente é a obsessão pelo minimalismo da parte de Edward, fruto do seu transtorno obsessivo-compulsivo. A casa é um reflexo dessa sua faceta, aqui levada ao extremo não só pelas várias exigências que faz aos seus inquilinos, mas também pela tecnologia presente, que parece esconder sob a capa da inovação e modernismo a invasão da privacidade dos seus moradores. Mas também há personagens com obsessão pela mentira, por uma pessoa em particular ou por determinadas práticas sexuais.Foi um livro que li num ápice, curiosa por saber o que, afinal de contas, tinha acontecido a Emma. Gostei bastante do início do livro, em especial pelo ambiente algo sinistro que o autor consegue criar, mas pareceu-me que a difícil tarefa de o manter ao longo de todo o livro acabou por não ser completamente bem sucedida. No final de contas, é um thriller psicológico interessante, com boas ideias e que, apesar de não ser perfeito, proporcionou boas horas de leitura."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.194257"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.194257"]]

The Girl Before is a fascinatingly frustrating read wherein the narrative is so much more clever and compelling than any of its characters, particularly the main two heroines, the girl before, Emma, and the girl after, Jane. Those two are just...insipid, infuriating, maddening. The book itself is essentially Fifty Shades of Grey with architecture. Both Emma and Jane in their respective timelines, which are precision interweaved throughout the story, occasionally dizzyingly so, fall for an obsessive compulsive domineering architect with Samp;M tendencies, Edward, after coming to live in his showcase of a house. Appropriately both the house and its creator have all the charm and warmth of a particularly ascetic modern design, you know the sort with limited number of uncomfortable overpriced furniture and slick austere nothingness. Yeah, that, apparently irresistible to a certain type of women, someone's who's undergone a recent tragedy, for example. And so the games begin...while Edward can't be entirely trusted, neither can as it turns out anyone. Delaney muddies the waters with unreliable narrators and suspense, so you just have to find out what's going on, and to her credit she does create a dynamic fun sort of a thriller, almost in spite of her oversexed imbecile characters. And so as entertaining as it was, the estrogen just overwhelmed it much too much for it to be genuinely good. Maybe I'm not its typical target audience. This was quite possibly meant for those who thought Fifty Shades of Grey needed some suspense and a murder or two. Maybe I shouldn't be referring to the book I haven't actually read, but I know the gist, doesn't everyone by now. At any rate shame to see an obviously talented author limiting herself to a trend, trends are stupid for the most part anyway, but surely money talks and all that.

One has shadowy parents, neither has siblings, and they are neatly set adrift with minimal back story in north west London, where we all know that the rents are high and the people unfriendly, apart from the single chatty neighbour.The architectural context could have been interesting but it was confined to some superficial descriptions of buildings (all of which involved \"pale stone\": could have done with some editing, I think) and lists of names of famous architects. A smattering of medical jargon was thrown in for good measure.As for the plot, the true villain was obvious to me from the earliest pages.

I absolutely could not put this book down and finished it in three days instead of one only because I had to go to work.The story is based around a house located at One Folgate Street. There are two women who apply to live in the house and the story is told from their points of view from the time they apply to the time they leave the house. In order to live in the house, applicants must agree to a long list of rules that were created by the builder who originally built the house to live in with his now deceased wife and son. Emma, lives in the house first with her boyfriend Simon. Then several years later, Jane lives in the house. The fact that the two women look alike and also look like the builder’s deceased wife with dark hair and blue eyes is slightly unsettling. I really enjoyed reading this book because the characters came to life through the author’s writing. I could imagine the open floor plan of the house and each room from the kitchen (they called it something else in the book) to the bathroom with the sensor-activated shower head to the hidden panel that lead to the mop and broom closet. The answer seems so obvious to what happened to Emma, so of course, I knew there had to be a plot twist.

An architecturally interesting house is yours for an incredibly low rent if you answer pages of personal questions, agree to live by an enormous number of rules, and somehow please the architect.

Juxtaposing the lives and experiences of these two different women inside of the same house at different times was fascinating. A peek into the suspicious death of the architect's wife and child added to the intrigue. And now the negatives: at the half way point suddenly the story seemed trite. Edward the architect suddenly starts sounding like Christian Grey (of 50 Shades fame). A psychotherapist willingly shares notes from Emma's sessions with Jane.

Yes, it’s an above average psychological thriller, just barely. It’s a story of two women who have previously been traumatized and want/need to move to begin anew. The story is told in alternating chapters of both characters. These ladies are drawn to this austere building that requires the completion of a complex multiple-choice questionnaire, along with pictures. In addition, there is an in-depth, multipage contract that the occupant must agree to and sign. Along with the telling of the story, the reader learns of some of the questions. The house has a history of occupants suffering traumas (aka deaths) while living in the house. As a reader, one wonders who in their right mind would go through the dog and pony show, agree to the contract, and move in. Through the description provided, the house didn’t sound that fabulous to agree to such crazy stipulations. Author JP Delaney does scrape up a thriller in the question of how previous women met their demise and who was responsible for the downfall.Nonetheless, this reader finished it. As absurd as it sounds, there is a true thriller aspect to it, if you mindlessly go along with the basic foundation. Do I recommend it? Not really. There are far better thrillers out there.

I’m still glad I ended up reading it, but it definitely wasn’t as good as I was expecting, and ended up being more of a fence sitter.The story is told through alternating POV. The newest resident of One Folgate Street, Jane, and the girl before, Emma. We know right from the get go something had to have happened, obviously, because One Folgate Street is back on the market and not still being lived in by Emma. I found the premise of the house itself to be more intriguing than the lives of the women and the people in their lives. Hell, I wanted to move into One Folgate Street after reading the descriptions of the location and how the house itself was set up.This is tagged as mystery/thriller/suspense, and really all of that revolves around Jane trying to figure out what happened to Emma. The author really tries to make the reader suspect one person right from the get-go, but I’ve read too many mysteries to fall for it, and gradually came to the conclusion myself who the perp was before it was revealed.Overall, when I finished the story I was left with the thought that you really never know anyone 100%, and Every. Single. Person. has secrets. Ever person in this story has had something traumatic happen to them:-Emma: House was broken into and she no longer feels safe.-Jane: Had a personal tragedy regarding a pregnancy.-The Architect: Lost his wife and child years before in an architecture related accident.But when it really came down to it, I kinda felt like the architect was the only one that was sort of coping with what happened to them, and trying to move on. Emma and Jane always came off to me like they were just trying to fill a void in their lives, rather than accepting the fact that you can’t fill the voids that struggles have left you with. Square peg, round hole. A thing can never be broken or cracked and be remade to be exactly what it was before.I would recommend this book to those who don’t have strong background in reading mystery. I think those readers are the ones that would enjoy this the most. I guess I’m just too jaded so everything was really obvious to me. Still really happy I read this, finally, and would most likely look into something else from this author.Copy received through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.259856"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.259856"]]

I had heard such good things about it and I honestly didn't want to be disappointed. Too much hype surrounding a book release often leads to let down in my literary experience. I’m happy to say, this book was well worth all the buzz and more! However, now I need to try to sum up my reading experience without ruining it for anyone else….hmmmmm. Here I go!The Girl Before alternated seamlessly chapter by chapter between its two main characters, Emma and Jane. The story was told both in the present day with Jane and in the past with Emma. Both women were reeling from personal tragedy and searching for big changes in their lives. Jane was looking for a new place to live after suffering through the stillbirth of her first child. Emma had experienced a home invasion and was held at knife point. The exact events that occurred during the attack have been blurred by trauma. She wanted to remember the attack, but also forget at the same time.At the different times in the book, both of the women were shown the same home...the spectacular minimalistic house - One Folgate Street. The house was extraordinary. The house was the winner of architectural awards, its design was simple and sleek. But this house had a violent history and a determined, unwavering owner, Edward Monkford. Edward had a reputation of being a handful to deal with. The application process, the rules, and the way of life that the Edward demanded of you to live in this house, would have made the average person run away screaming. But not these two, they were blinded by the house's beauty and the idea of a simplistic lifestyle allured their senses.The twisting tale of these women and their experiences with the house and Edward kept me up at night, and reading until the wee hours of the morning. In my personal down times, I found myself contemplating where the plot was heading, and who was the true villain in the story? I changed my mind over and over. If you were to ask me, that's the true sign of great storytelling! That and the fact that I feel like I can't put all my thoughts on this one into this one review. It would be a disservice to how good this book was!Now, with that being said I don't think this book is for every reader - as most aren’t. I think people who enjoy mystery and thrillers will like it. The people who like to identify with the characters in the book may not. I personally didn't really like any of the characters. Jane was probably the most likeable for me. Edward was a big double thumbs down, a real turn off for me! I don't care how good looking and powerful you are or pretend to be, no one is going to tell me how to live! End of story!

Emma has just experienced a traumatic break in at her flat and is looking for a new place to live, but can’t seem to find something that is both affordable and feels safe to her. Until she looks at One Folate Street. The house is a minimalist design made of pale stone, high ceilings, plate glass and a very open floor plan and is considered to be an architectural masterpiece.But the enigmatic architect who designed the house has over 200 rules for living there, including no books, no photos, no clutter, no throw pillows or other personal effects as the house is meant to transform it’s occupant. Jane has just suffered a personal tragedy and is looking for a fresh start, which she believes she has found at One Folate Street. The space seems to bring her a sense of calm that she hasn’t felt in a while and she also feels drawn to the architect who created it. Shortly after moving in, Jane learns about the death of the home’s previous tenant; a woman who has a similar appearance to her. As Jane begins to investigate what happened, she has to untangle the truth from all the lies. She unknowingly begins to the follow the same patterns, make the same choices and cross paths with the same people and also begins to experience the same terror, as the girl before.I received an ARC of The Girl Before about 3 months ago and I so wish I had read it sooner because I absolutely loved it. It was not at all what I expected it to be. The story, as mentioned above, is told from two perspectives; Then: Emma and Now:Jane. So the perspectives switch every other chapter but it was very easy to follow alone. Also, in between most chapters is a question from the application package when the girls applied to One Folate Street and from the follow up surveys the girls filled out while living there. I also thought that was a nice touch and some of the questions did make me stop and think for a moment. I don’t want to give too much of the plot away but I do want to mention a few things. I really liked the author’s writing style and I felt that even though we split time between Emma and Jane, we got to know their characters pretty well. The architect, Edward, is also a very interesting character. This was one of those books that I could not stop reading because every time I thought I had the plot twists figured out, it would go in a different direction. I read almost the whole book in one day. It really captivated my attention. I can honestly say most of the plot twists I didn’t figure out until they happened and the author did a really good job with that. And the ending was also pretty good, not as dramatic as I had expected it to be, but unexpected. There is some sex in this book, which I like to mention when it’s a book that I normally wouldn’t expect to contain detailed sexual encounters. The scenes are all well done and it is nothing over the top. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.Thank you to the publisher for sending me an advanced reading copy of this book."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.284377"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.284377"]]

Years apart, each woman applies to be a tenant and each woman develop their own relationship with the man behind the design, Edward Monkford. When Jane finds out that years earlier, the previous tenant, Emma, died in the home, she begins investigating the death. Untangling a web of lies, she follows down a similar path and soon finds herself in the same danger as the girl before.The Girl Before, by JP Delaney (a pseudonym), is a book that has been getting consistent amounts of buzz in the book blogging world; I was dying to read this one!I was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy and I have to say, I have some seriously mixed feelings about this book. I found myself feeling equal parts mesmerized and strange while I was reading. What I Liked:  The Narration: the novel is narrated with alternating viewpoints from tenants at One Folgate Street: Jane, the present tenant and from Emma, the woman who lived there previously. This technique kept me glued to this book. The segmented chapters are short and sweet and use the right amount of hook to carry the story along. As the women’s experiences begin to mirror each other, things become creepy really quickly. Throwback to Gothic Literature: Fun Fact. I have always been a fan of classic gothic fiction and this novel certainly resonates with this genre. From the massive, sterile house to our female protagonists threatened by a powerful, tyrannical male, this one had moments where it read like Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho. I really liked how this one gave a modern twist on the gothic novel and combined it with the domestic thriller genre that has swept 2016 by storm.What I Didn’t Like:  Kind of gave me a Fifty Shades of Grey vibe: Edward Monkford was Christian Grey to me. The novel had moments where sexual domination took the lead and the actual story took the backburner. I have a very hard time taking a book seriously when the character, which is supposed to be the antagonist, is consistently referred to as “Daddy”. I feel like I would have enjoyed the book much more if this part of the book had taken on a smaller role. Regardless of my feelings about that portion of the book, I cannot deny that this one kept me up, late into the night, to finish. I was consumed by the plot and need to find out what happened. It already has the movie rights sold, so I will be intrigued to see how this will play out on the big screen. If you are a fan of a dark, twisting thriller, then I would recommend this book. However, if you hated the idea of Fifty Shades of Grey, then chances are, you will not appreciate this one either! Thank you to Penguin Random House Canada and the author, JP Delaney, for a copy of this one!

For Emma, she requires a safe place after being the victim of a break-in while her loyal boyfriend, Simon, was out. For Jane, it is a new place that holds no reminders of the baby she lost. For each woman, the house at One Folgate Street seems to offer exactly what they are looking for. It is designed by well-known architect, Edward Monkford, and comes with a set of rules created by the inscrutable man himself. In fact, to live at One Folgate Streets means signing off on over 200 rules, ranging from no books or personal mementos, to total tidiness, to agreeing to showing the house on architectural tours, to accepting to the intense technology that it comes with, including the house monitoring your well-being and moods. At first, the rules and clarity that come with One Folgate Street seem comforting to Emma and Jane. But as they spend more time in the house--and learn about its past, including its mysterious builder--they become terrifying and stifling. THE GIRL BEFORE is a fascinating novel told solely from the point of view of Emma, One Folgate Street's previous tenant, and Jane, its current tenant. All activities are filtered through the lens of these two women. The novel effectively builds suspense with the parallel nature of the two women's stories, but it also can get a little repetitive at times (and sometimes a little confusing, as you have to remind yourself, mostly in the beginning, who is talking). The book starts off exciting, as you are drawn into both Emma and Jane's tales while they acclimate to the house and all the oddities it offers. The house itself almost becomes another character in the novel. It starts to drag a bit halfway through as you wonder what will happen in the next half (people living in a technologically advanced house can only be so exciting, right?). But then, suddenly, the novel takes some odd turns (there are some interesting sexual plot twists) and eventually grows quite interesting again with some psychological and thrilling revelations. Perhaps my favorite part about this book is that many of these developments truly surprised me, which isn't always easy to do in a thriller. Overall, this is an interesting novel. It's certainly suspenseful and different. To enjoy it, you really have to set your disbelief aside at the actual conditions of living at One Folgate Street (no books, what?!) and accept that the two women are so broken (and perhaps broke, as the house apparently comes at a great discount) that they will go along with anything. It has a lot of varied plot threads and some of them aren't always fully explored or truly necessary, which can be a little frustrating. Still, the book truly surprised me with its twists and kept me entertained, with a deep desire to get to the end. Overall, 3.5+ stars.

While this book is being touted as the next Gone Girl/Girl on the Train (which is becoming tiresomely overused), I wish it would have been advertised as the next Fifty Shades of Grey so I would have known to steer clear. I am not surprised at all to see this novel being made into a movie adaptation and I suspect it will be quite well received by many. The relationship aspect, which was a huge part of the novel, was just not for me. I don't typically enjoy emotionally damaged women that are helpless to the charms of men simply because they are rich and handsome, nor do I enjoy novels reflecting such an uneven balance of power and/or huge red flags for an abusive relationship but the women stay because the sex is good. So those parts of the story just did not work for me. I will say, however, the mystery aspect of this book is really well done here - the plot really keeps you guessing (I didn't figure out some things until the very end) and the use of the house as a character is really very clever and effective. There is a certain level of voyeurism at play with the reader - I particularly liked playing along with the quizzes/moral dilemmas - a very successful plot device - and the introduction of life choices (how does one evaluate possessions). I also now want to incorporate karesansui into my next home (I love being introduced to new concepts). But I found myself enraged at one character that literally eats food that is absolutely abhorrent to her because she thinks it will turn a man on and another character that grossly misrepresents a sexual assault.

But this one intrigued me, and I'm glad I took the chance. This is a unique, beautifully told story.The book is written in alternating timelines, both in first person. Each character has a distinct voice and a strong personality. I didn't particularly like either woman, in that I wouldn't choose to hang out with them in my real life, so the fact that I enjoyed spending time with them fictionally speaks volumes about the author's storytelling talent. I found Jane to be a much more sympathetic character, and some of her scenes in particular were incredibly powerful. Both characters are complex and well developed.As I write this, the pre-publication promotion touts this book as a psychological thriller. 'Thriller' doesn't fit. It's far more of a slow-burning suspense. This is the type of book that gets under your skin with foreboding darkness, the hint of things to come, and the way the characters, and we as readers, remain slightly off balance throughout. Much of the story takes place within the house at One Folgate Street, with its minimalist design and enforced lifestyle. I was fascinated by the author's approach to this unique concept as a foundation for the story.My only grumbling point is a stylistic choice made by the author. Delaney does not use quotation marks for dialogue throughout Emma's POV sections. I came across this method once before in experimental literary fiction. I didn't like it then, and I didn't like it this time either. Quotation marks are subtle reading cues we don't even notice until they're missing. Their absence forced me to think more in order to figure out if sentences were being spoken aloud, thought, or were part of the narration. For me, this hurt the story's flow, as I was constantly questioning the way I interpreted things. Jane's POV sections do have quotation marks for the dialogue, so I'm not sure what the point was in choosing not to use them for Emma's parts.*I was provided with an advance ebook copy by the publisher, via NetGalley, in exchange for my honest review.*"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.295286"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.295286"]]

One Folgate Street is an architectural masterpiece, completely minimalist in its design. But, the owner of the home, Edward, is incredibly controlling and finicky about who can live there. To be considered as a tenant for the house you must fill out a questionnaire than can only be described as bizarre and intrusive. And, there are rules to living at One Folgate Street. No throw pillows, no pets, no photos, no clutter and no books just to name a few. The story follows two women’s tenures at One Folgate Street – Emma, who is recovering from a traumatic break in and searched out a new place to call home, is the “before” and Jane, recovering from a personal tragedy, is the “now”. After Jane realizes that Emma had met a deathly end inside One Folgate Street she starts to do some investigating into Emma and what she finds is unsettling. I won’t really go into any further detail on the plot but this book is incredibly creepy and will have you hooked until the end. I couldn’t read it fast enough. Is the owner/designer of the house a dangerous man? Or is he just controlling? Was Emma murdered? Was her death an accident? Does the house have a mind of its own? There is an element here that reminded me of 50 Shades of Grey when the story delves into the sexual relationship that brews between Edward and both Jane and Emma; that is something I could have done without. This is going to be made into a movie adaptation and I think it will be a really good, creepy movie.

I was kept on my toes all the way til the end of the book and loved the little twists thrown in at the end.

Both experienced tragedies before moving into the home. They had to fill out questionnaires and send pictures and agree to a slew of rules to even be considered as renters (no simple credit check and steady job could get them into this sterile, odd place). The home won architectural awards, but residents who live there can’t leave dishes out—even the cleaning supplies are well hidden in a secret wall panel. There aren’t even book cases—no clutter is allowed whatsoever. I couldn’t imagine living like that (I wouldn’t make it a day), but both women are in dire financial situations, and the home is modestly priced because no one would live there with the millions of rules if they could afford a normal place. I couldn’t identify with Emma or Jane or the architect of the home, Edward, who is a perfectionist and possibly a sociopath (hence the creep factor).There were some nice twists and turns I didn’t see coming, which is great, but I didn’t fall in love with the ending.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jun 07, 2017"], ["review_text", "Just another thriller to add to the growing pile of subpar genre fiction. All the publishers seem focussed at the moment on finding the next Gone Girl or Girl on the Train. This is being sold in most places as a powerful new female driven thriller, or to use a buzzword, \"domestic suspense\" The writer \"feels gratified\" at how people think HE is a woman because he wrote two women so well. Yes, JP Delaney is male, and no I don't hold that against him. What I do hold against him is the fact that I wouldn't consider writing two women who portray all the stereotypical aspects of the Hysterical Woman to be writing women well. Emma-Manipulative-Unappreciative-Sex crazed-Proned to fetishism-Compulsive liarJane-Grieving the loss of a baby-Desperately wants another baby-Focussed on her career and miss out on family and love-Calculating-SecretiveEmma and Jane-Both develop an almost instant obsession with Monkford-Both seem to have sexual awakenings because of Monkford and discover they lean toward fetishism-Both spurn the same man (Simon, and to a much lesser extent, Saul) to be with Monkford-Both give up huge amounts of personal connections in order to be with Monkford and live in Fulgate Street-Both are suspicious and deceitful I really felt, as I continued to read these two women that they are each one side of a coin, making one whole woman, who, if she lacked Emma's compulsive lying and Jane's need for a baby, might just be the perfect woman. But you throw Monkford into the mix and both women become putty for the moulding. They both lose all credibility and chance for redemption the second they let Monkford control them. These aren't well written women, they're caricatures of women that men who are anti-woman think represent or resemble women as a whole. Thematically, my interest was completely lost when the grieving mother storyline entered. Not that I don't have sympathy for any mother who has lost a child, but because I can't identify with it. I feel that this theme or subplot really alienates a large section of the female readership (which is in turn a large section of general readership of all books)I am not a woman on a quest for a child and when this becomes such a prominent storyline in any book, it's like the shutters just drop and I'm thinking \"here we go again\" the woman is having her actions explained away because \"her condition made her do it\" or maybe it was \"her fragile state of mind\" If you think this is a contentious point, look at these books for examples of exactly the same device:-Pretty Baby by Mary Kubica (proof is in the title here)-The Couple Next Door by Shari Lapena (also a second rate and utterly awful book)-The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins (she was never pregnant but many of her actions are driven by the desire for her husband's new life which includes the baby that should have been here)-Leave Me by Gayle Forman (she ditches her husband and kids because they're essentially shitty people who do nothing for her then gets involved with two other people with child related issues)It would be cool if Delaney had written these women as two different kinds of villains, which is essentially what I think he was going for, but without turning them into stereotypes. Make them utterly morally repugnant, don't just hover on the border of \"hmm maybe they'll make some questionable decisions\" it's a cop out. I liked Simon as a character, I felt he had the most depth. He was the darker side to Monkford's darkness. He masquerades as the doting, adoring boyfriend who would do anything for his girlfriend or wife when he is actually using kindness as a method of control. While Monkford is outright controlling and upfront about it from the start. I hated the ending where a new character gets introduced for one chapter. This is probably a tool left in place for potential sequels, but it really irks me. Finish books properly, a really clever writer can write a sequel without leaving themselves an entry point in their previous work, just in case they get a sequel. Also, can we stop with the alternating viewpoints please? PLEASE?! It's so tired and over done. I'm at the point where I won't buy a book if this is the method of writing. I didn't think this was a revolutionary book in any way, I resent a little the hype this was given at publisher events prior to publication because it definitely didn't live up to them. It's not the next big thing and I'm not in a hurry to read anything more by this author."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.339873"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.339873"]]

There's a lot going on and it's difficult to figure it all out. I'm still not completely sure I have it all figured out. I normally don't like books like that, which leave me with questions, but in a way, it felt right with this book. The whole book has an air of mystery and it feels ok to leave something on the table.This is also the kind of book where no one really comes out looking great. It's difficult to tell who is a \"bad guy\" and who is a \"good guy.\" Everyone had issues, and that's part of what brings them together, and ultimately, tears them apart.I really liked the suspense of it all.

Представете си една безупречна, фантастична къща с много светлина, простор и минималистичен стил, чийто собственик е известен архитект. На пръв поглед изглежда невъзможно точно тази перфектна къща да бъде следващото ви жилище.Модерната сграда на „Фолгейт Стрийт 1“ е като от онези снимки в списанията – изглежда недостижима и специална и в нея не може да живее всеки. Даа, сигурно трява да има някаква уловка, би било твърде хубаво, за да е истина, нали така?Изобщо не се учудвам, че романът вече е преведен на 39 езика и се е превърнал в бестселър, който предстои да бъде екранизиран под режисурата на носителя на „Оскар“ Рон Хауърд, известен с филми като „Аполо 13“, „Красив ум“ и „Шифърът на Леонардо“. И да, неслучайно сравняват „Момичето преди“ с „Не казвай сбогом“. Предричам, че много ще се говори за тази книга и тепърва ще я виждам в ръцете на мнозина – в метрото, на пейката в парка, на плажа…„Момичето преди“ е точно това, което търся в един криминален роман – необикновена история, чиято сюжетна линия да ме грабне, да ме накара да прелиствам шеметно страниците и да ме остави удовлетворена след прочита. Психологическият трилър деликатно засяга и доста социални теми, което за мен го прави още по-пълноценен. Така че, ако сте фенове на този жанр и си търсите нещо добро за четене, горещо препоръчвам да се запознаете с „Момичето преди“!Цялото ревю - тук: http://azcheta.com/momicheto-predi-dz..."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.359619"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.359619"]]

Es scheint zu schön um wahr zu sein, die Wohnung ist sehr günstig und dazu noch hochmodern ausgestattet. Allerdings ist der Einzug in diese 4 Wände an eine Vielzahl von obskuren Regeln gebunden, die das Architekten Team aufgestellt hat. .Es darf nichts auf dem Boden herumliegen, es gibt keine Papierkörbe, keine Wäscheleinen und keine Sofakissen – Treppengeländer und Absicherungen stehen genauso auf der Verbotsliste wie natürlich Haustiere und Kinder. .Trotzdem überlegt Jane nicht lang, da sie sowieso ihr Leben ändern möchte und einen kompletten Neuanfang wünscht und willigt ein. .Parallel zu Janes Geschichte lesen wir immer wieder Abschnitte aus der Vergangenheit von der direkten Vormieterin Emma die auf tragische Weise in eben diesem Haus ums Leben gekommen ist. Auch Jane ist auf das Mysterium um Emmas Tod gestoßen und beginnt zu forschen. Sie findet heraus, dass die beiden Frauen sich nicht nur sehr sehr ähnlich sehen, sondern auch, dass ihre Geschichten um die Folgate Street 1 auch exakt gleich abgelaufen sind! .Bedeutet das nun etwa, dass auch Jane diesem Haus zum Opfer fallen wird? Und was hat überhaupt der verschrobene, perfektionistische aber gutaussehende Architekt Edward Monkford mit der ganzen Sache zu tun?Dieses Buch hat es geschafft, mich von der ersten bis zur Letzten Seite zu fesseln. Zwar war mir Emma nicht durchweg sympathisch, aber sie war authentisch und das ist das wichtigste! Ich habe total mitgerätselt wie das alles nun zusammenhängt und bin durch viele Wendungen gegangen die ich so nicht erahnt hätte, das Ende war sehr überraschend aber es passte perfekt und erschien nicht konstruiert.Klare Leseempfehlung von meiner Seite aus wenn ihr auf Psychothriller steht!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.362300"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.362300"]]

It was only the beginning but I could feel myself being frightened by the eerie sense the story gave. By this alone, I was amazed by how the author could do this to my reading experience so very quickly.One Folgate Street is very secure and private. It has the latest technology for the security system. The house comes with a whole set of rules and is set for a simple lifestyle without the added essentials of our lives. The house felt like a character in the story and it's what elevated the creepy feel.\"It has—well, it's a pretentious word, but it has integrity. I think he's looking for people who are prepared to be equally honest  about the way they live in.\"Emma is an unreliable, unlikable character who has issues. She went through a burglary and a possible sexual assault, which is what leads her to want to move out of her home and search for a safe place to start over. One Folgate house is the perfect place to start fresh, especially after what she went through. She meets Edward, who's the architect of the One Folgate House. Very soon, they start dating and Emma loves all the attention she receives from him. Unfortunately, something happens that ends with Emma being dead.Perhaps the house will turn me into a better person. Perhaps it will bring order and discipline to the random chaos of my life.Jane is a strong, independent, brave woman who went through a miscarriage. After the miscarriage, she quit her job and found a job in helping other mom's who go through miscarriages. Because of this, her income is low, but the prices for an apartment or house are high. One Folgate Street is the only one that Jane can afford. She sends in her application and is accepted. She feels very safe in the house and is happy with her decision of living there. When she starts seeing Edward, a few questions arise and slowly, she starts to question her relationship and her living situation.But what if the house itself decides not to protect me? How safe am I really?Edward is a controlling, manipulative man that I found myself being disgusted by. At first, I was kind of liking him and drawn to him, but when he treats Emma in the past the same way he treats Jane in the present, says the same things, gifts the same things, I was just appalled and creeped out by him. His character did enhance the eerie feel of the story, which I did like a lot. I couldn't figure out his motives and that still made him interesting to me.\"Excellence is what matters. Excellence and originality.\"The last two chapters of the story had me saying WTF so many times. I have no idea how many times I re-read those pages. I'm telling you, there's a whiplash at every turn the story makes! The story had lots of twists that had me doing a double-take and re-reading the pages because I couldn't believe what was happening.The Girl Before is a mindblowing and addicting masterpiece that left me completely transfixed and fascinated.This review was originally posted on Latte Nights Reviews."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.393618"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.393618"]]

The premise is great, if rather batty (who would honestly agree to live in a house with so many restrictive rules. You’re not allowed books! Come on!). The story is entertaining with an impressive number of twists to keep you guessing. When it comes to uncovering who was responsible for Emma’s death, there are enough plausible suspects to keep you intrigued.On the whole it’s easy to read, although the dialogue in Emma’s chapters isn’t marked off by inverted commas, which can slow the pace down as you try to separate speech from thought.And, if you like creepy, this book delivers it in spades. As the story alternates between “Emma chapters” in the past and “Jane chapters” in the present, the parallels between the women’s experiences are gradually revealed and the similarities at times, particularly in their relationships with Edward, made me shudder.However, I have issues with the sexual politics of a story in which the two main characters are largely ok with having a narcissist trying to control them. I can’t really say more than that because it could be giving away some major plot points (sorry!).I also felt things started to go haywire in the last quarter of the book as the twisting and turning went too far, pushing the plot from far-fetched to ridiculous. So while I wasn’t bored for a single second while reading The Girl Before, I have to confess to a fair bit of tutting and eye-rolling.Overall: fans of creepy psychological thrillers will love The Girl Before. I’m sure it will be very successful and I look forward to seeing how closely the upcoming film adaptation sticks to the book.Thank you to Quercus Books and NetGalley for the e-ARC."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.396119"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.396119"]]

Hier habe ich mir eine spannende und ereignisreiche Geschichte erhofft und diese auch größtenteils erhalten.Ich muss gestehen, dass ich anfangs ein paar Probleme mit der Geschichte hatte, denn der Anfang war doch sehr zäh, sodass ich mich auf den ersten 50-75 Seiten ganz schön durchbeißen musste. Danach konnte mich die Geschichte jedoch immer mehr packen, sodass ich letztendlich doch eine spannende Geschichte vorgefunden habe.Erzählt wird hierbei die Geschichte von Jane, die es im Leben nicht immer leicht hatte und von daher dringend einen Tapetenwechsel benötigt. Das Glück steht ihr dabei auf der Seite, denn sie darf in ein modernes Haus in einem angesehenen Stadtteil in London ziehen. Als sie dazu noch Edward kennen lernt, dem das Haus gehört, scheint ihr Glück zunächst perfekt zu sein, denn sie beginnt eine Affäre mit ihm und glaubt, dass ihr Leben nun besser wird. Dieses Leben beginnt jedoch immer mehr zu bröckeln, als Jane erfährt, dass es bereits eine andere Frau in diesem Haus gab, die ihr nicht nur sehr ähnlich sah, sondern dazu in dem Haus verstorben ist. Dabei kommt es auch immer zu Erlebnissen aus der Vergangenheit aus der Sicht von Emma, die in dem Haus verstorben ist.Die Geschichte ist trotz kleinerer Schwächen stets spannend. Zwar gibt es auch hier die ruhigeren Momente, die sich stellenweise ein wenig ziehen, allerdings erlebt man hier insgesamt eine interessante Geschichte mit vielseitigen Figuren, die zwar nicht immer sympathisch sind, in die man sich aber dennoch in gewisser Art und Weise hineinversetzen kann. Das Cover passt gut zur Geschichte, gleichzeitig erkennt man auch direkt das Genre und eine düstere Stimmung, was ebenfalls gut zur Geschichte passt. Die Kurzbeschreibung liest sich spannend und hat direkt mein Interesse geweckt, sodass ich \"The Girl Before\" sehr gerne eine Chance gegeben habe.Kurz gesagt: \"The Girl Before\" ist ein interessanter und spannender Thriller mit vielseitigen Figuren, der zwar am Anfang seine Zeit braucht und auch um kleinere Längen nicht herumkommt, mich aber letztendlich dennoch überzeugen konnte, sodass ich das Buch gerne gelesen haben. Wer bereits Bücher von Paula Hawkins mochte, sollte auch JP Delaney eine Chance geben!

The book tells the story of Emma and Jane, both tenants at One Folgate Street, a house that is a minimalist's and architect's dream. The house was designed by famed architect Edward Monkton. He still owns the house but rents it out to people he deems worthy. Prospective tenants have to complete a questionnaire, a personal interview, and agree to the 200 rules he imposes. Despite all the restrictions, he manages to find people who want to live there.The book alternates points of view, and chapters, between Emma and Jane. Emma is the past tenant, Jane is the current one. There are similarities between the two women. Both are victims of recent tragedies. Emma is traumatized by a recent break-in at her home that occurred while she was there. Jane by the still birth of her first child. Both women are looking for a fresh start and feel that One Folgate Street can provide that.We learn early on that Emma died in the house. It is unsure if the death was an accident, a suicide or murder. When Jane learns of Emma's death, she begins to investigate it. The alternating chapters really hi-light the similarities between Emma and Jane's experiences in the house. Seeing them making some of the same choices, really increases the tension. This book is a psychological thriller. Between Edward's increasingly controlling behavior, and what we learn about Emma and Jane's lives, the reader just doesn't know what to think. Did Edward kill Emma? Is Jane now in danger from him? Or was someone else to blame? We don't find out what actually happens until the very end.I thought this was an enjoyable book. It was fun and easy to read. The chapters were all short and fast paced. I would recommend this book to my friends who are looking for a nice escapist read.I received a free ARC from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.405855"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.405855"]]

One ended up dead and the other one who comes after her is determined to find out the truth.Sounds interesting? Yes it really is. I was really mesmerized by Edward the mysterious architect. He is possibly a psycho and I am tense waiting for the big reveleation in which he finally reveal his true self. Also this is told by the alternating POVs of Emma and Jane. We gotta read the events leading up to Emma's death. The whole story was pretty good up until that ending. Nothing really explains and I don't even understand how it all happens(view spoiler)[ What is Edward's deal? why he gotta repeat the same events with 2 different woman?What is the purpose of this house?Those are the questions been bugging me. It seems like Edward's character is merely a distraction or a decoration  (hide spoiler)]"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.408448"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.408448"]]

Emma is the past resident of the house and Jane is the current resident. It was a great way to present the story.-The ending was a real surprise but it was plausible - I realized that I had missed some clues along the way.What I didn't Like - There was too much unneeded sex.-I am so tired of book titles with the word GIRLS in them when the characters are actually WOMEN.Overall, I thought it was a great read and I definitely enjoyed it.Thanks to Book Browse for a copy of this book.

Emma and Jane are two damaged women who are both separately searching for a home that will provide them with the qualities they are desperately seeking: security, safety, and peace. They find it at One Folgate Street. This story is told in two different POVs: one by Jane and the other by Emma. One of them is living in the present and the other in the past. One is still alive and the other is dead. Their reasons for searching for a peaceful, quiet and minimalist location to live in may be different, but have caused them great pain. The one thing they do share is who they fall in love with. Enigmatic, mysterious and alpha-male Edward is what most women tend to fantasize about. Edward is intelligent, successful and handsome. He lives an incredibly strict and innately detailed lifestyle. Those he chooses as tenants to live at One Folgate Street need to abide by his stringent and lengthy contract. There are very few who would be willing to give everything up to live there, but for Emma and Jane it's exactly what they're looking for.As time goes on, the beautiful and pristine home can't keep them blinded from the truth forever. As time goes on, they begin to suspect that underneath that immaculate exterior lies a secret so dark and deadly that it may cost them their lives. This was a great story! I usually love reading books that are very fast paced, but I had no problem getting absorbed into this novel. I found it to be enthralling with just the right amount of suspense and character growth.

Part of me liked it very much, a big part. But I've got some niggles with it, and in writing this review, it might help me understand my feels a bit.LikedThe state-of-the-art home where our two protagonists lived. It was a breathtakingly impressive place, which had all the gizmos and gadgets cleverly hidden away to create a perfect minimalistic living space. I'd have to break some rules to live there though. Books and cushions.Characters with unlikable traits. Yeah, I do like that. I enjoy their flawed and twisted personas and trying to fathom them out. The subtle hint of kink. Yep, these were not vanilla folk. The author brought just enough to give it some sizzle, without too much detail. Some things are best left to the readers imagination. Learning about Japanese cuisine. There's far more to it than sushi and friggin hot wasabi. (See also 'Disliked')How the two MC's POV's and stories merged as the story progressed.DislikedThe first 30-40%. I just couldn't get to grips with it! Those two girls, both with simple names, Jane and Emma. I couldn't for the life of me distinguish between them initially. I resorted to having a scrap of paper by my side whilst reading, with 'Jane, - present, Emma, - past' scribbled on it so I knew whose voice I was hearing. It's mad, it could of been just me, but I really had issues with those names. Both four letters, both very British, both rather samey. I dunno. *shrugs*It had a half-way-through-major-eyeball-rolling-moment. It was predictable and typical.Learning about Japanese cuisine. Urghhhh! Is that shit for real? No way. Nope. Stay away from my mouth.So, my conclusion is, that, yes, it was a unique story experience, with twists that kept me engrossed until the end, but it wasn't sensational.Thank you to NetGalley and Quercus Books for the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.451756"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.451756"]]

One Folgate Street was originally going to be built to be the family home of world famous architect, Edward Monkford but when his wife and child are killed, he rips up the plans and designs a unique house that molds the renter fit the house. There is an almost impossible list of questions and stipulations that must be agreed to by the prospective renter and even then it has to be approved by Edward Monkford. What first attracts people is the price. It is extremely reasonable and once they get used to the seeming austerity of the house, the beauty.The first renter in the book is Emma and her boyfriend Simon. They have just had a break-in at their current apartment that has left Emma fearful for her safety. Emma has found security problems at all the other apartments they have seen. One Folgate Street offers total security. To enter or use anything in the place they must wear a band that lets the place know you belong there. The sensors built into the house operate everything. Emma and Simon fall in love with the place and they apparently answered the questions satisfactorily as Edward Monkford approves their application. But soon after they move in, it becomes only Emma. Simon is thrown out of the picture and I believe it is mainly to do with Emma's initial attraction to Edward.The Girl Before fluctuates between Emma and Jane. The current resident is Jane and Emma is the girl before but we only learns what happened to Emma and what is happening to Jane as both their stories unfold. What happens to Jane has a lot to do with her curiosity about what happened to Emma. Both of them are wounded souls, Emma because of the break-in and Jane because of a stillborn baby.Both become intimately involved with Edward. He is very handsome, mysterious and domineering. Emma wants a man to take charge of her. She looks back on Simon as being too meek. She wants a man to dominate and protect her. She finds Edward all to willing to fill that role but he makes it very clear that he believes in short term intense relationships. Emma, like many women in relationships, believes that she will be the one to change her man. Unfortunately Emma seems to find lying easier than telling the truth and her lies start unravelling and so does her life.At one point in this book I consider putting it aside because Edward is coming across as super creepy. I decide to continue further and I'm glad I did. The book takes hold of me and pulls me in to the point where I have a hard time putting it down.Jane comes to live at One Folgate Street after the her stillborn birth of her daughter Isobel. She is vulnerable and Edward sees that and they too begin an affair. I don't understand why all these women are drawn to Edward Monkford. Too me he just comes across as creepy and the book wants you to see him as the villain of the story. Jane agrees to all of the demands asked of her to live in the house but her character is stronger than Emma's. She has noticed the similarity of Edward's deceased wife, Emma and herself. She starts investigating what happened to Emma but to keep what she's doing a secret from the house, Jane must go to a corner of her bedroom so she can use the neighbor's WiFi.In the end she survives an encounter with an unsuspected danger and proves that she was using Edward as he was using her. I am very glad that I continued reading through to the end.In the author's write up JP Delaney is revealed to be the pen names for someone who is already successful under possibly 2 different names. I thought of Nora Roberts with her JD Robb series or JK Rowling with her Cormoran Strike mysteries. It will most likely come out eventually but it is a neat twist.I received this book as a member of Suzanne Beecher's First Look Book Club and courtesy of Penguin Random House and I have given my honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.495784"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.495784"]]

In other words, I loved it. In a strange and twisted way. Just like everything is in this novel. It starts with an absurd concept, and you think, it can't get any worse but it does. Oh dear, it does. It crawls under your skin, shakes your bones, makes you sick in the night. It's messed up. In an eerie and beautiful way. Moreover, The Girl Before raises many controversial questions of the 21st century. This novel challenges you in every possible way. First, it makes you write the list of all of your essential possessions. Emphasis on essential. So, cross out that eyeliner and fuzzy slippers. Then, it makes you live in the house where 95% of people before haven't even lasted longer than a couple weeks. The house is indeed an architectural masterpiece created with a purpose of changing the resident. It's so sterile, you feel like a blank canvas - ready for a new start. And the house will either force you to start over or force you out. One Folgate Street's goal is to make your physical and emotional well-being better. That is the first question The Girl Before brings you to, shall architects create \"buildings with a sense of purpose?\"Second, it makes you a subject to a house. One Folgate Street is an amazing creation. I was absolutely fascinated by a house that monitors health and well-being of the tenant. The house is equipped with all sorts of sensors, therefore creating the most pleasant environment. The lights, the temperature, the water, the AC, the appliances - the house adjusts everything up to tenant's physical and emotional parameters. It's insane. It's beautiful. It's genius. It's future. That brings you to the second question, would collection of physical and emotional parameters with the goal of general improvement cause the conflict between privacy and technology? Third, it makes you reconsider your social choices. Because, honestly, what is going on in The Girl Before is equally messed up to Gone Girl. I am not exaggerating. It's like ice-cold water in the face, a wake-up call, a horrible realization, a gun to the head. Who do you trust? Who do you lie to? Who lies to you? All and no one. Everyone is this book is goddamn insane but so bloody real. Personalities are amplified, yes, but, honey, they are real. And they make you wonder, to what extent actions can be justified by love? I read The Girl Before on my trip to New Orleans at night. This made the reading experience even creepier. I was not able to close my eyes until the next day, and this heavy feeling was gnawing upon me the entire day. I finished the novel over three weeks ago but I still can't stop thinking about it and the residents of One Folgate Street. I feel haunted. I feel heartbroken.

The focus moves between the lives and experiences of Emma Matthews (‘Then’) and Jane Cavendish (‘Now’) at One Folgate Street in London, UK. One Folgate Street is a minimalist house designed by a reclusive architect, Edward Monkford. Those who seek to live there need to fill in a lengthy application form, and will need to abide by some 200 conditions stipulated under a restrictive covenant if their application is approved. Very few applicants are approved.‘It’s an extraordinarily tight contract.’Then: Emma Matthews likes One Folgate Place: she feels safe there. After a burglary in her last place, she is looking for security. Emma and her boyfriend Simon move in.Now: Jane Cavendish is looking for a new home. Somewhere to recover after the sudden death of her baby daughter just days before her birth.The novel shifts between ‘Then’ and ‘Now’, between Emma and Jane. Clearly Emma and Simon are no longer living at One Folgate Street when Jane moves in. But when Jane discovers that Emma died at One Folgate Street, she becomes curious about the girl who lived there before her.‘It seems One Folgate Street has a somewhat tragic history, he says.’So, what happened to Emma Matthews and her boyfriend Simon? Why are the tenancy rules so inflexible for One Folgate Street? Who is Edward Monkford, and why has he designed One Folgate Street in such a controlled, minimalist fashion? You’ll need to read the book to try to find the answers to these questions The more pages I turned, the more I became caught up in the story. My own brief obsession (I read the novel over two days) was to find out what had happened to Emma. While there are many disturbing similarities between Emma’s story and Jane’s, there are some significant differences. And just when I thought I’d worked out what happened to Emma, another twist would have me looking in another direction. It’s claustrophobic and obsessive, and I can understand why Universal has bought the film rights.Did I enjoy this novel? Yes, mostly. I had envisaged a slightly different ending, but I’m not disappointed. I’d like to know more about the author, though: J.P. Delaney is, apparently, a pseudonym for an author who has ‘previously written bestselling fiction under other names’.Note: My thanks to Hachette Australia and NetGalley for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.506781"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.506781"]]

My thanks to the author and his/her publisher.Has anyone else noticed that there are a slew of books in the past few years that have included the “Girl…” in their titles? The 'Girl' In The Title: More Than A Marketing TrendHere's a trend in new books: Publishers commonly promote them by comparing them to other books — and when the books are crime fiction or thrillers, and written by women, they get compared to the same books again and again and again.

Of course, there were a few things I didn’t like so much:•\\tFirstly, there were several 2 page chapters. There needed to be more space and development between alternating points of view. I am not an idiot; I can remember similar occurrences that happened between the two girls and Edward without it having to be repeated hard on the heels of each other.•\\tI would have liked the relationship between Emma and her psychiatrist to have been developed a bit more.

Especially if they're lackluster (though I do admit that I wasn't all that impressed with Gone Girl and it's my least favorite Flynn novel). This is my fault, really. I hate that mystery books are all compared to GG and GOTT, but I still pick them up, even though I've been burned time and time again. Unfortunately for me, The Girl Before was yet another burn.The Girl Before tries to be this edgy, steamy thriller that has shades of GG and 50 Shades of Grey. The thing is that it fails in every conceivable way. Mind you, I haven't read 50 Shades of Grey (and will never, ever read it due to how it seems to fetishize controlling behavior), but The Girl Before seems to have tried to captivate the same kind of steaminess (or rather try to captivate the people who considered FSOG steamy and not just icky w/ it's control factor). But it's not steamy, it's icky. And it's not edgy, it's just the same predictable mess that's come from all of the other GG wannabes.My main issue with The Girl Before is that the women are stupid. The main characters fall under the \"stupid characters do stupid, stupid things\" category. The Emma chapters were just a mess. Pretty much the author trying to throw everything, but the kitchen sink in there. They were so implausible (and that whole \"Daddy\" thing? Icky as fuck). And what was with writing the Emma chapters without quotation marks? Was it to differentiate the Emma chapters from the Jane chapters? Well, it worked. Cause I differentiated them by thinking, \"Oh, here are the Jane chapters and here are the pretentious, special snowflake without quotation marks chapters.\" It was so annoying and so unnecessary.Jane was no better. If Emma was pathetic, Jane was ten times worse. She gets all this evidence that Edward might not be a good dude and she constantly ignores it. She doesn't want to take anything those people tell her at face value, but has no problem taking what Edward tells her at face value. In fact, she's so pathetic that she wonders why all these guys are obsessed with Emma, while simultaneously lamenting that no one is obsessed with her. Really? You're upset because no one seems to be stalking you? Go home, Jane. You're drunk. So what does The Girl Before have going for it? It's a page-turner. That's it. Besides that, it's a mess. It's predictable, the least unique book you'll ever read, and full of unlikable characters who deserve to get hit by trains.

When I’d put down the book and pick it up a few hours later, I couldn’t remember which event/thing happened to which girl, because the story-lines were too similar. The whole book was too disjointed, simply because the two P.O.V. were too much alike.And what really bothered me about Emma’s chapters were the absence of quotation marks. I completely loath when writers feel the need to do this. Half the time, you can’t even tell who’s talking in Emma’s chapters, because, like I stated, there are no quotation marks. It was a big guessing game: Are these Emma’s thoughts, or is she speaking out loud? It’s such a headache to read a story with dialogue that breaks one of the most important rules of grammar. The lack of “” was distracting to the story and very off putting. \\tThe writing itself was sort of dry. A lot of “says…insert adverb here (drily, tartly, etc)” \\tI also found bits of this story to be too far-fetched. I don’t care how fancy or nice a house like One Folgate Street is, no one in their right mind would live in a place with so many rules and restrictions. I mean, no furniture? No books? Although, as much as I’d like to say the technology inside the house was teetering on the edge of science fiction, it really wasn’t. I can see variations of smart houses like One Folgate Street popping up in the future. \\tThis book did have its creepy moments, but it wasn’t exactly thriller or hair raising if you know what I mean. Yes, the house was eerie, but it wasn’t scary. \\tOn a good note, there were a couple twists and turns within the story that surprised me, and this really is a book you don’t want to put down. And, I did get The Girl on the Train vibe towards the second half of the novel which is always a good thing. \\tThank you to NetGalley/the publisher for this ARC. This is my honest, unbiased review!"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 2], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.515004"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.515004"]]

I love books that have a resolved ending that leaves me feeling satisfied about the outcome. :DThe Girl Before follows the story of Emma (in the past) and Jane (in the present). It's a story about a house (One Folgate Street) that is a perfect home for people who want a nice house but can't afford an expensive one. But why is it so cheap? The one condition to purchasing this home is that you have to agree follow The Rules and be accepted after a strict application process, which most people don't pass.Emma is looking for a new start after her and her boyfriend's apartment was violently broken into while she was home alone. A little further in the future, Jane suffers the death of her perfect baby girl and wants to start over in a new home that doesn't remind her of the baby. Neither one of them can afford an expensive home, and they both are amazed by the simplicity and minimalist style of One Folgate Street. To apply for the house, the women fill out a long questionnaire with seemingly odd and sometimes personal questions and send photos of themselves along with it. Both of them send in their applications and receive an interview with Edward Monkford, the architect of the home. Monkford is gorgeous but controlling, and both women are drawn to him.Soon after she moves in, Jane finds out that the woman who lived in the house before her (Emma) had died under strange circumstances. She also finds out that she bears a striking resemblance to Emma - and to Monkford's late wife. Jane becomes obsessed with Emma's story and finding out what happened to her. I don't want to ruin anything so I'll stop there!The writing was very well thought-out and I really liked the way that it was told. The alternating chapters of Emma's POV (in the past) and Jane's POV (in the present) fit together really well. I thought that it was full of suspense and the ending was definitely not expected. Also, readers will never guess who \"the girl before\" is. I thought I had it figured out early on but I was wrong. The whole book was brilliant, in my opinion.Copy provided by Netgalley for a review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.537681"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.537681"]]

Yes it did - I raced through it in two days.One Folgate Street in London, England, is a architectural wonder. It is minimalism to the extreme. Stone, glass, white on white, no doors. And much is controlled by the Housekeeper - a computer program that takes its cues from the bracelet that the inhabitants wear.And who lives there? Only those chosen by the architect - after undergoing a rigorous application. And acceptance of the many rules of the house - no mess everything must be out of sight, no photos, no colour and much more.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"After a break-in, Emma see living in the house as safe, a sanctuary against danger. After her divorce, Jane sees the house as a clean slate, a new start. Emma lived at Folgate before Jane.The Girl Before is told in alternating chapters from Jane and Emma - now and then. When Jane learns of the previous tenant's death, she becomes consumed with finding out more - even though she is discouraged by the enigmatic Edward, the architect/owner. The reader is privy to the events during Emma's time in the house. And knowing what we know, the tension ratchets up as Jane seems to be following in her footsteps - and into danger......I felt like I should be on Emma and Jane's 'side', if you will. But as the book progressed and more of their personalities and their (questionable) choices are revealed, I found I didn't overly like either of them. But I still desperately wanted to know what next. Edward - well, he's in his own category. And I'm not too sure why either of them find him so appealing, but hey, this book wouldn't be the same without him being this way. Control, it's all about control with this guy. In his life and in his house. Super creepy.Gentle readers be warned - there are a few somewhat graphic sex scenes.Just get yourself past accepting that anyone would actually move into a house such as this with crazy rules and you are in for a deliriously addictive, psychologically twisty turny read with a nice little gotcha in the end."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 4], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.540860"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.540860"]]

Can architecture make social and personal interventions? These questions get raised but are ultimately subsumed beneath a pretty standard 'psychological' thriller: characters are damaged, pathological liars, psychopaths hidden in plain sight, and obsessive-compulsives with a bit of sexual exhibitionism thrown in for good measure and a couple of murders.The writing is smoother than is often the case in this kind of commercial fiction: the sections are very short, sometimes only half a page, at most a couple of pages, switching between Emma 'then' and Jane 'now'. There's lots of misdirection going on but personally I feel it's cheating to have twists that depend on 1st person narrators simply lying to us...So an enjoyable piece of fluff that I whizzed through in one sitting: I'd like to see Delaney do something more intelligent with the intriguing ideas that get suggested here but which ultimately have little to do with the plot.

This is a pseudonym for an author who has already published fiction under another name and you could tell that this wasn’t their first rodeo so to speak.The Girl Before is a psychological thriller that will have you guessing from the get go as the present and the past go on an eerily similar journey. This story is told in two point of views, Emma (The Girl Before) and Jane the present. Emma took up residency at One Folgate Street after an aggravated burglary left her with a crippling fear of living in her old house. The new house had to be high security to give her that “safe” feeling and One Folgate Street was the only property that fitted the bill. One Folgate Street was the brainchild of top architect, Edward Monkford and was as high spec as they came and extremely minimalist. Only tenants willing to go through an intense veto process and adhere to some two hundred rules could live there and that meant giving up everything that you didn’t need, living with the bare necessities and living clean and tidy. The house had a brain as it were and monitored the residents, adapting to their day to day routines, their preferences and their dislikes. It was a social experiment of sorts and one that the residents knew they were a part of, hence the affordable rent for an otherwise unobtainable property. \n  \n    “You can make your surroundings as polished and empty as you like. But it doesn’t really matter if you’re still messed up inside.”\n  \nJane is the current resident of One Folgate Street and is currently coming to terms with losing a child and One Folgate Street is her clean break and fresh start. Jane fell in love with the property and is immediately taken by its creator but it is not long before the walls begin to bleed their secrets. Once Jane becomes aware of the tragic past of the property she takes it upon herself to investigate…with startling revelations. Will the present mimic the past? \n  \n    “There was a time when One Folgate Street seemed like a calm, serene haven. Now it doesn’t. It feels claustrophobic and aggressive. Like the house is angry with me.”\n  \nI will say that because Emma and Jane’s stories were so startling similar at times, it did become hard to keep track of whose point of view I was currently reading. I found myself flipping back to the beginning of chapters when the characters began to blur. I did notice that Emma’s point of view did not contain any speech marks, if this was a way of differentiating between the two it didn’t work for me, it only made reading those chapters a tad confusing. It may be that there was a different method behind this style of writing but it wasn’t immediately apparent.\n  \n    “Never apologize for someone you love, he says quietly. It makes you look like a prick.”\n  \nThis was an addictive read though, one that I couldn’t put down. JP Delaney cleverly built this story, slowly peeling back his characters like the layers of an onion. As each layer is removed the character’s secrets became fewer, the truth more apparent and I was anxiously waiting to reach the centre. With each chapter, the more engrossed I became and while the beginning is a little slow to get going, it soon becomes apparent that the pacing was deliberate in its lure to totally submerse you in Emma and Jane’s story. This was a clever manipulation of the mind as your brain screams at you to believe one thing, yet your subconscious tells you another. Do you rule with your heart, head or your gut instinct?I did have a few issues with The Girl Before, hence the rating, but as psychological thrillers went this certainly held my attention from the start and left me with that constant fear of woe throughout. I did feel that the ending was rushed and did not feel any particular closure with Edward and Jane and while I could see where the author wanted to go at the end, its delivery let it down. While this book does stretch your imagination at times, I am sure that someone, somewhere has already invented a house like this, whether I would want to be a part of it…hell no and I did find myself struggling to come to terms with the residents willing participation. Sometimes though the allure of grandeur knocks all common sense from people and picking on an already vulnerable person was probably the kick starter to garner anyone’s interest. However, it was gripping, it had my mind running a mile a minute, even taking notes as I tried to decipher fact from fiction, truth from lies and throw those red herrings overboard. I am usually wrong, I would be a crap detective but I did get this one right.\n  \n    “I built something as simple as a mausoleum because that was how I felt at the time. But then I realised that in my madness I’d inadvertently created something extraordinary. A house that would demand a sacrifice from anyone who lived there, but which would repay that sacrifice a thousand-fold. There are some it destroys… But some it makes stronger.”\n  \nThis is soon to become a film, I can see the allure and personally cannot wait to see how this is depicted on the big screen.www.theromancecover.com"], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 3], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.559915"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.559915"]]

But in this case, there were moments where I genuinely felt like I was reading a  Gone Girl rip-off. There were other moments that felt like a carbon copy of  The Girl on the Train. And, because apparently we needed to make matters even worse, this book also felt like it had healthy dashes of  Fifty Shades of Grey thrown in there. Cue me throwing up.What is this book about? Two women, separated by a couple years, going through the same process of moving into a new home and starting affairs with the architect who built it. His house comes with hundreds of rules to ensure that every detail of the tenant's life is like something out of a wet dream of Marie Kondo. His relationships come with just as many regulations. I think the point where I wanted to throw the book across the room in disgust was when this man told one of his lovers that she should groom her pubic hair because it wasn't perfectly symmetrical....but there were a million things just like this. He was possibly the most vomit-inducing love interest I have ever read about. Having to witness not one but TWO women fall for this guy was torturous. The two timelines have so many similarities IT IS LIKE READING THE EXACT SAME BOOK TWICE. WHY.The ~mystery~ aspect was lacking. I felt like J.P Delaney was trying desperately hard to cram in as many shocking moments as possible but it wasn't done in any sort of original way so I could predict everything because it was all so overdone. And this is coming from someone who rarely reads thrillers. I felt like so many of the reveals just involved a character turning out to be some sort of general \"crazy person.\" This is not only boring but also just offensive. Some of the most intense moments of the book were actually cartoonishly ridiculous to me. There's a plotline about rape that I found EXTREMELY disappointing and absolutely unforgivable. If this is something you're sensitive about, I recommend skipping this book completely but I'll add a spoiler about this in case you need it: (view spoiler)[Basically, it's very triggering and graphic and then it turns out that the rape allegations were completely false. The protagonist actually accuses two separate men of raping her and then two OTHER men of abusing her. The abuse is pretty minor compared to the rape in terms of attention in the plot. But yeah. It's all absolutely shitty. I have very low tolerance for false rape allegations in fiction.

The mutual setting is an unusual apartment - one that is a living model of high architecture - designed by an enigmatic architect. Emma and Jane narrate two different narratives that bring them to live at this unusual residence at separate times. While different circumstances brought them to their new home, their lives share similarities - particularly as they abide by the stringent rules set by the architect - and later by their relationship with the architect himself. Both women, too, are haunted by the titular girl before - in Emma's case, she becomes obsessed with the first wife of the architect, while Jane becomes obsessed with Emma.The chapters alternate between the two women and the similarities (and later, the differences) really amplifies the tension. As echoes of the two women's lives ring out across the whole, it really makes this an absorbing read. The plot moves along at a fast pace and does involve more surprises to the plot than I expected. At first, the book really feels like a straightforward read and each woman's actions and investigations adds complexity to the plot and their characters. Jane's section in particular has a tragic backstory, that may be a bit too sad for some readers. But, overall, it is an exciting and engaging read. The conclusion fits nicely, too.

Delaney"], ["date", "Jan 26, 2017"], ["review_text", "When choosing a book to read I often follow my gut feeling, especially when it comes to the authors that I don't know - although JP Delaney is a pen name for a best - selling author, and when reading \"The Girl Before\" I was looking for any hallmarks but I didn't guess the real name - and when spotting this book I just had a feeling that this could be THE read. And well, yes, it turned out that I should trust my gut feeling as the book was totally engrossing and kept me glued to the pages. \"The Girl Before\" was a provocative, incredibly smart story about controlling and manipulations, making reader to ask who is reliable there and whom shall we trust.Now. \"The Girl Before\". We can start debating who the hell would go and live voluntarily in a house with 200 stipulations including no pets (no way), no children, no cushions, no curtains, no personal things on the floor, no books (hello?). And yet they signed on the dotted line. The house itself is an example of minimalism and the latest and best home technology, adjusting itself to the weather, temperature and probably the mood of the inhabitants. Originally designed by Edward Monkton as his family home but there was an accident on the site when his wife and his young son died. Also, he is the one who, after interviewing the prospective renters, is to decide if they're going to live there or not. Weird, no? Who in their right mind would go for something like this? I wouldn't, and I don't want to go into this debate, but I thought that it is a brilliant and unique idea and premise for a book. For me the book sounded unique, not like others books that I read, and the only thing that didn't work so good for me was the end, that sounded too Disney-like and somehow didn't sit with the book. However, this is probably the only thing that I'm going to criticise. There were maybe some things that made me feel uncomfortable, just like building the house on the grave or some scenes with abuse - both human and animal - but nothing that would make me cringe.The story alternates between Emma (Then) and Jane (Now), and the chapters were short and dynamic and it also made the story flow and reading much quicker. It was also the writing that makes this book so outstanding. It is sparse, but it is incredibly hooking and just beautiful - we can say just like the house! It just feels like the house, to be honest, white and with no barriers or unnecessary things and beautiful in its frugality. The way the stories of Emma and Jane mirrored made me feel a little claustrophobic and insecure, to be honest, it brought a lot of tension and changed my perspective more than once.I loved how the story was divided between the two points of view. Both of them were in the first person but I've never had a problem to see who's speaking. Duh, the chapters did have titles with the name of the characters! I also liked the way both stories were interwoven and how quickly and effortlessly they picked up when the other has just finished. Really, as the chapters flip back and forth the similarities between the women and their lives started to feel suspicious and somehow creepy, and it was obvious that eventually I'll start to suspect Edward as well.I think the characters there are not created to be liked by the readers. Their decisions didn't help to warm to them, and it is not that I had problems with the characters but I did think that both the women, Emma and Jane, were incredibly naive. There were thousands of warning bells that they chose to ignore and the way they meekly agreed to be controlled by both house and Edward was remarkable and odd. I mean, allowing a man to control your diet and exercise? No, thank you. It was even more surprising that they were like lambs because they were both relatively troubled women and they should know better.The house on One Folgate was like a living and breathing character itself, to be honest. I really started to believe that the house is trying to destroy the ones it doesn't approve of, that it controls the lives. It was truly extraordinary how the author managed to create this special, claustrophobic atmosphere of this place.It is not a book that is destined to make you scared or look over your shoulder. It is a book that is destined to make you feel tension and suspense, keep you in the dark and play with your mind. It is a slow burner, this novel, but with this kind of book it shouldn't be different - well, you can't expect the biggest twist to be explained on the first pages, right. No, you're expecting it to grow slowly in tension, to change tracks, to pull wool over your eyes, and \"The Girl Before\" just does it. However, as the circle of suspects was very limited in the novel, the end didn't come as such a BIG surprise, although the last quarter of the story truly meddled with my mind and made me change my opinion about some characters.Because of the slow pace it takes some time for the book to really pick up, and it happens when Jane discovers that someone died in the house before, and it also takes time for Emma to start to feel afraid. However, even with it taking time, for me it was engaging, interesting and unusual read. The way the story developed was very masterfully and skilfully plotted and organized and I absolutely admired this feeling of dread that the author smuggled onto the pages.This is a story about secrets, lies and appearances that can often be deceiving. It is one huge rollercoaster ride full of ups and downs and there was something very special in it and I didn't want to put it down. It is an engrossing mystery, even if the characters are not too likeable - but they don't have to be in this kind of story. It is good enough that they are multi - layered, they are very complex and I think that no matter what, we never know if they're telling the truth or if they're hiding something. It was a thought - provoking, addictive and a clever read, multi - layered with many surprises and I highly recommend \"The Girl Before\" to you.Copy provided by the publisher in return for an honest review."], ["platform", "Goodreads"], ["star_rating", 5], ["img", "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485972587m/28016509.jpg"], ["created_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.595998"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-23 17:29:47.595998"]]

But I almost think it does a disservice to the book they're trying to get me to read. So I almost avoided this. Alas, the actual description here on Netgalley was so riveting I requested it, and I'm thrilled that I did (no pun intended)! I want to read a book because YOU think it's great, not because it's just like someone else's book (I didn't even like The Girl On The Train. Rachel was far too pathetic for my taste.)Now THIS... this was an innovative spin on those other psychological novels. The house itself became a character. I actually wish that was explored more. I loved the way all of the characters developed here. (view spoiler)[ There were a couple of 'wait what?!\" moments that threw me off that I fully intended on writing here like 'why would she uh, slob his knob when the burglars forced her to do that exact thing to them? Why not just have sex. But you know... that was taken care of.My huge qualm was that the ending felt like the author was like 'Welp, why don't we just go ahead and make everyone a psycho. Even though house. He's a psycho! She's a psycho! Everyonesssss a psycho!!!! It felt a bit cop out. Also, Edward was much too precise through the book for him to just be like 'let's get rid of that and make a new one of our own' about the baby. The way it was written he sounded like a child having a tantrum and it was disappointing to see his character make that jump.Then when she said she had a surprise of her own... that she had planned the baby. No. What? No! (that was me when i read that) I thought she was going to say the baby didn't have downs and she was just testing him. If it was part of her plan it should have been something the reader was aware of. There were enough surprises at the end that it would have served us readers better. WE would have wanted to believe Edward was good when she was trying to find out who killed Emma. We would have been championing him WITH her and even MORE torn about him being the possible killer.That being said, it was still a great and riveting book. And the ending happened so quickly that I can forget it and just act like it ended my way. LOL!

I'm also excited to learn there will be a movie adaptation coming out, directed by Ron Howard, which is impressive in its own right especially considering the book won't be officially released until next month so apparently someone has faith in its success and I don't disagree. The Girl Before was a fast-paced, psychological, thriller that alternates point of view and narration between Jane Cavendish, in present tense, and Emma Matthews, a previous resident of the house Jane is now renting who died tragically at the residence under suspicious circumstances. Both women find common ground at One Folegate Street, an architectural wonder, designed, owned and dictated by Edward Monkford but aside from that and their striking physical resemblance the two women have little in common. Emma is deceitful and manipulative and dishonest to the core, where Jane is good hearted and well meaning, trying to recover from a recent still birth and uncover the history of the home she now lives in and the mysterious deaths of several of its former inhabitants. The home itself comes with many rules and regulations that the renter must agree to and follow under strict supervision of Edward Monkford. In a way this reminds me loosely of Fifty Shades of Grey even though I didn't like the Fifty Shades Trilogy at all and I thorough enjoyed The Girl Before, however there were definitely similarities. The dynamic between Edward and the women in his life for one, his narcissistic personality, his obsessive compulsive tendencies and need for absolute control, to name a few. I really liked the contrast between Jane and Emma. J.P. Delaney did a great job creating realistic, three dimensional characters and I found it was easy to become invested in them because they were so real, despite their character flaws. This was an ending that I didn't see coming, in more than one way actually, and that's something that I considered absolutely necessary in a good thriller. I will say that I found myself a bit disappointed at the very end. (view spoiler)[**spoiler alert** I don't want to say too much but I personally wasn't pleased with the choice Jane made at the very end. Perhaps it was the noble thing to do, however, if Edward had given me the same choice if I were in Jane's shoes I am quite confident I would have gone in the opposite direction then Jane went and I was hoping she'd do the same. I don't want to give to much away so I'll leave it at that.I read a lot of books from this genre and I can honestly say this one can hold its own amongst the vast competition out there and I'd definitely recommend it and look forward to seeing the movie version when it comes out.

Are you good enough for the house? What sacrifices can you make if you want to live here?

No things on the floor, no pictures on the wall, no pets, no kids, no curtains, no rugs, and much more. The house should always be open to tours and architects, and you will be required to submit to impromptu questions about yourself or certain parts of the electrical system will shut down.

Emma seems similar to Jane, which sends Jane on a mission to find out what happened. he mysterious death is just the beginning.This was a really quick read for me. I found myself really liking both Emma and Jane. There were pretty similar sounding at first, but as the story went on things changed. Neither of these girls is really likeable, although I did feel really sorry for Jane. The love interest for both of these women was horrible.

He would have had to be more than just good-looking to be worth all the trouble.The house has some really cool features and I loved learning about them all. An app on your phone can control the house, which is nothing really new. This house also learns from you and will remember things like what temperature you like the water in the shower to be. This house, through the app, can also tell you if you need to pick up more milk or eggs, since it can sense what is in your fridge. While all that sounds cool, I was left thinking about what a violation of privacy not having curtains, and almost certainly having cameras in the house would be.The twists were okay for me. The pacing of this story was excellent until about 60% where the characters started to show their true colors and the story started to unravel for me. It didn’t go anywhere near where I expected it. I hated almost everyone by the end of the story and felt certain the house was indeed cursed.In brighter news, I heard this was to be made into a movie directed by Ron Howard.

The character from the past is Emma. From the present, we have Jane. They have a lot in common, and it starts with them renting a house. The house is very unique. It is austere, and there is a very long list of rules that you must agree to in order to live there.Both of the girls end up in a relationship with the architect, Edward. As we weave through both of their stories, we see that their relationships are very much the same, following the same patterns as Edward asserts his dominance.Emma has a violent past. She was attacked in her old apartment where she lived with her boyfriend, Simon. They move into the new house to help Emma get over it. She and Simon soon break up.Jane's past involves a still-born daughter. She is also trying to heal. Jane finds out that Emma died in this house, and becomes somewhat obsessed with finding out how.They both find out that Edward's wife and daughter were killed while the house was being built and are forever interred in the foundation.The Girl Before is a weird story. This house is very high-tech. And between that and the rules, it seems to change the personalities of the people who live there. It's hard to explain without your reading it, and I don't want to spoil too much.Ultimately, it's a mystery about just what happened to Emma, as well as Edward's family. But the journey to these answers is very entertaining.I found the lack of quotation marks annoying. And even more annoying is at some points Delaney uses them, and then other times not. It had to do with which character was talking, but it was hard for me to adjust back and forth. I didn't see a need for this technique. In other books like this, I eventually got used to it, but with The Girl Before, it kept switching back and forth.While I was suitably surprised by the outcome, I still felt the ending needed some more punch. I was expecting a weird, exciting twist, and I just didn't get it. I would still recommend The Girl Before. I found it easy to read and very engaging. I'm not sure I would recommend this to most teens because of the sexual situations; it's definitely an adult book.Added note: the Amazon entry for this book says it's soon to be a motion picture directed by Ron Howard.

The story is told from each woman's point of view, with Emma's story being 'Then', and Jane's story being 'Now'. Emma and Jane both end up choosing to live in the same house, located at One Folgate Street. They had to jump through some unusual hoops in order to live there, however.Prior to being approved, anyone interested in living in the starkly minimalist house is required to fill out a form with some rather odd questions, and agree to live by a set of 200 rules, which includes having no books, photos, throw pillows, or anything else that is considered 'clutter' in the house. They must also include a photo of themselves, something each woman thought odd.The architect and owner of the house is a man named Edward, who originally built the house for his family. After losing his wife and son, Edward never lived there, choosing instead to rent it out for an extremely low price to anyone who was willing to live by his stringent demands.Both women become involved with Edward, and when Jane finds out that Emma—whom she closely resembles—died in the house, she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her. Was it truly an accident, or something more sinister that killed Emma? Was Edward involved? Despite being warned against it, Jane is relentless in her search for the truth, never realizing she was putting herself in danger... until it was too late.The Girl Before is a deliciously creepy psychological thriller worthy of the genre. I devoured it in a single day... I just couldn't put it down until I knew who did what, and why. There were several surprises along the way, but the last one left me so stunned, you could have knocked me over with a feather. I'm not kidding. My jaw hit the floor and I kept shaking my head in disbelief because (and I know I say this a lot) I NEVER saw it coming.Treat yourself and get a copy of this book when it hits the shelves.

(Yeah I know its a bit of a cliché) But it was true.The book is divided into two stories that ultimately involve the same house 1, Folgate Street. It tells the story of Emma who was a previous tenant and her chapters are titled Then : Emma and the current tenant Jane and her chapters are titled Now : Jane. Both their stories revolve around an enigmatic architect called Edward Monkford who has somewhat of a tragic history.Edward Monkford designed 1, Folgate Street which is the cutting edge in minimalistic living and unobtrusive technology. He has a lot of rules (at least 200) for whatever successful applicant he lets out his house to. Some of the ideas for the house are actually quite amazing but how long before an occupant would start to feel the sterile walls start to close in around them? This part of the point of the story, to have next to no personal possessions apart from the absolute essential and have the house with its own computerised system called Housekeeper. (Which is monitored by Edward) Nothing is private.Emma and Jane are two very different people who have both been through trauma and although their stories are told in the present and the past they feel like they are running together. There are divides between their chapters that ask questions with multiple choice or agree/disagree that are subjected to the tenants but can also make you think what would you do?There is a mystery surrounding what happened to Emma that Jane is determined to get to the bottom of as well as trying to find out what makes Edward tick as they start a relationship of sorts. There is much manipulation going on within the pages from most of the people in book so at times it is hard to feel sympathy for everyone as more and more is revealed. There are dark deeds at work and not everything is as it seems, which is good to have at the heart of a mysterious thriller, after all!

You have two parallel stories, both from the point of view of a different young woman. One has lost a baby at full term in a terrible birth story that I found very moving, the other has been badly mentally damaged by being the victim of a home invasion. They both at different times live in a house which is austere, minimalistic and which demands a great deal of sacrifice by those who live there. You must pass a complicated test, take regular re-testing and allow architecture students access to the house. There is a mystery surrounding the house, rumours that there was a terrible accident involving the architect's wife and that she died on the premises. The architect is an enigma, compellingly attractive but also complicated and apparently very available! The house has secrets, the architect has secrets, everyone is unreliable, nobody can be trusted.If you analysed this from a feminist perspective this is a book about abuse in lots of forms, it is a book full of characters who should have known better, who behave badly and who are a bit pathetic. I had annoyances in how the author portrayed the women, I looked up to see if this was written by a man or a woman, turns out this is a pseudonym for a man, colour me unsurprised! No woman would have written these women this way. But when you are reading it and you suspend your disbelief and cynical eye, it is a really good read. It is pacy and compelling.

The chapters alternate between Emma and Jane, past and present. Each of these young women are willing \"audition\" to rent a clinically beautiful and technologically advanced house by a famous minimalist architect. First comes a long questionnaire of odd and personal questions. Each young woman fills out the questionnaire which also requires three photos. Hmmmm. The weird questions and the photo requirement didn't set off any warning bells? If Edward Monkhouse, the architect and owner, likes the responses, then he grants an interview to decide who is appropriate for the house. Of course, both Emma and Jane get an interview. There are rules--lots of them: no books, no rugs, no personal effects, no photos, no clutter. A computer \"housekeeper\" monitors everything in the house. Both Emma and Jane are unreliable narrators and willing to surrender their personalities to fit the house and the architect. I have a thing about people who give up everything to satisfy another person or ideological belief. I know it happens, but it is almost impossible for me to imagine. It is one thing for it to happen gradually as in a Stockholm Syndrome situation or a domestic situation that develops over time as a matter of gradual reconditioning, but for an eager almost immediate surrender to someone else's dictates?

Delaney. Though lured by a strong synopsis that promised a solid mystery, I knew I was in trouble with this book early on, simply because I didn’t buy the main premise of the story. Even bearing in mind the crazy cost of London rentals, I just don’t believe that anyone would want to live at cut-price One Folgate Street, no matter how futuristically ground-breaking its design might be. Why? Because to live here pretty much means signing your whole life, including all of your possessions, away. It also means signing a contract that contains more than two-hundred clauses (I’m not exaggerating), thanks to a landlord who is, to put it mildly, a complete control freak.The landlord in question is Edward Monkford, the renowned architect who designed One Folgate Street, and now rents it out to a very select few tenants. Jane is one of these tenants, as was Emma, the ‘girl before’ of the title. The Girl Before employs a dual timeline, and it soon becomes clear that both Jane and Emma’s time at One Folgate Street follows eerily similar patterns, including the fact that both women inexplicably start to fall for the utterly charmless Monkford. The catch? Monkford has a dark side. He also has a past. The other catch? Emma didn’t leave One Folgate Street alive – she left in a body bag. Will Jane escape the clutches of One Folgate Street before it’s too late? Will she say ‘screw it’ to all those clauses in her contract, and run? She really should.An instant bestseller with a movie in the works, The Girl Before was also recently named ‘Thriller of the Month’ by The Sunday Times.

Although, I have never heard of the author J.P. Delaney this book is going to be the most talked about book in 2017 when it hits the shelves and stores around the world. This story is told from alternate POVs which I've absolutely come to love in books. We are being told a story from \"Before Emma\", a previous occupant in yet a very unconventional but architecural marvel, who once suffered from a home break in and has come to this home for safety. Next we have \"Now Jane\", the current occupant, who was lead her to forget her past and her personal tragedy. Both are trying to escape their past, while seeing their journey parallel to one another and both fall and begin relationship with the owner of this crazy amazing home. Which by the way the home itself could be another fascinating character in the story. Well that's a glimpse of what's to come if you read this book. You'll be guessing until the end.

The idea, he claims, is that people can be changed by this state-of-the art dwelling and minimalist living style. The narration alternates between Emma (THEN) and Jane (NOW). Each has her own personality and both have recently experienced an event that has left them vulnerable and weakened. Now they become obsessed by the house, the architect, and those that lived there before -- especially when it seems that death has visited. The characters have a lot of depth and the chapters are short so the book moves very fast. Manipulation, deception, and suspicion lead to only one end.Ignore the fact that these books of psycho drama featuring women are now always compared to those titles I will not name, but you know what I mean. There is a lot of hype about this novel, and it is definitely one all fans of this genre should read. The author is writing under a pseudonym and you can tell it's not a debut work.Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine for the e-book ARC to review.

I think I would've liked a bit more time on each character before swapping over in paragraphsI also found the minimalist rules hard to swallow. Conditions of being able to rent mean these women have to give up all their possessions and follow a series of rules set out by the creepy architect of the house who may or may not have killed his wife and buried her under the patio. I understand the need for a fresh start but how about a bit of de-cluttering instead??The language is sparse, designed to suit the house and minimalist ideas giving you a quick read. I do actually like the design of the house as I could picture it with everything having it's place but I'm not signing a lease that bars me from cushions to keep the aesthetic.

A pacy read, it alternates between the viewpoints of two women, one before and one after. The plot centres around a house that first Emma and subsequently Jane have signed up to live in, despite a hefty set of unusual rules, and an owner who may not be quite what he seems. It kept me interested and was a quick, easy read, with some good shock moments peppered throughout, and the obligatory 'twist' at the end. Overall, however, it wasn't outstanding. I didn't really care for either of the main characters, or anyone else in the book for that matter, but then in all of the thrillers I have read in this vein, that has been the case. It is a light, entertaining read probably suited to fans of the other big players in this sub-genre (Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train etc. etc.) but aside from one or two well written creepy moments, it won't be one you can't stop thinking about. I do feel it could have been elevated to provide a higher shock factor if Jane had made a different decision towards the end of the book, and indeed this lack of decision is the only element that has stayed with me after finishing reading. I hear it has been picked up for a film version, and it reads like it was written with just that intention.

I'm not sure about the comparisons to Gone Girl, because this book doesn't have time for the intense character development of that book, because it has more characters, one being a very cool, and yet disturbing house.  This book goes back and forth in time, alternating between two women who both rent a cutting edge 'smart house' from a mysterious architect who interviews new residents and gives them a set of rules.  These rules are not just the 'no pets-no-kids' type rules--more like a 'lifestyle' set of rules with questionnaires popping up periodically that cause the 'smart house' to shut down all amenities until the questions are answered.  A bit over-bearing, just like the landlord, a handsome, mysterious award winning architect who believes that our living spaces should change and define us.  Now you get a sense of the weirdness of the house, and it's builder so it's on to two very damaged women who live in the house at different times. One, who's had her previous apartment burglarized, and the other woman who's had a stillborn child's.  The plot moves back and forth between the two women as we learned what really happened. Since this is a thriller, I don't want to give anything away.  Just have fun reading and trying to guess 'who done it'.

Slabs of pale stone, expansive plate glass, soaring ceilings, tile floors, a stairway with no railing.  An app controls lighting, shower pressure and internet access. There already have been three deaths at the site.  Maybe another one soon?Edward Monkford, the owner and architect, rents the austere structure at a bargain price, but there are stipulations.  No clutter of any sort.  Compliance is monitored by sensors and cameras.  An applicant is interviewed by the sleek owner and fills out a long questionnaire, which begins: “Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.”The story is told in alternating chapters by Jane, the new tenant, and Emma, “the girl before.”  They look alike.  Both are recovering from traumas.  Both become involved with Edward.  Jane learns that Emma died in a fall from the unguarded stairs and that Edward’s wife and young son were killed in an accident during construction at the site.  According to Emma’s therapist, Jane is in danger.  From Edward?  Will Jane become the next  girl before?”  We find out at the violent climax.I hesitated to pick up another book with “girl” in the title, having read “Gone Girl,” “The Girl on the Train” and others.

They have to complete a lengthy questionnaire on their values, submit to an interview, and provide three photos.  It is framed as a social experiment.And then every now and then the Housekeeping program sends more questions and until the occupant answers them, certain functions of the house are shut down.The story is cleverly told and for a while the reader can't tell if the  girl before  is Emma or Jane.  I don't usually like alternating chapter voices, but this is well done.As the story unfolds, the reader learns more about Emma and Jane.  Neither has been quite honest.I'm not usually able to guess who  did it  but I did in this case.
